Thus, it has to find a way to execute all these projects so that people can see them clearly. “It is not just the hard infrastructure but also run the economy in a way that there will be confidence for people to invest because it is only when they invest that we can get the taxes. “We, also, need to make sure that funds are used judiciously and in a way that will reduce the cost of governance. “If you look at the federal budget, when you take out what the executive and other arms will spend, it is not that much, we need to create more trust and an environment where Nigerians are willing, are able to invest and are excited to be Nigerians,” she said. She added that the FIRS was not the agency that spends the tax collected but it is to administer taxes, adding that citizens in turn need to hold political office holders accountable. “It is the citizens that have to hold political office holders accountable and they hold us accountable for delivering on our target, they have given us a target of 10.4trn. “If Nigerians need to know what their tax is being used for, the budget office website is there, they release a quarterly budget implementation report, they can engage with it. ‘During the budget process, the budget office also releases what they called a citizen guide to the budget,” she added. Convener of summit, Bode Gbore, said there was need for the federal government to rebrand the unity of purpose to build a better Nigeria. Gbore, who is the Senior Special Adviser on Political Matters to the President, Bode Gbore, said the event was organized to open the channel of direct conversations between the government and citizens and it has proven that Nigerians are interested in making contributions to the development and well being of the nation. He said: “Knowing that the job of Nation Building, is an assignment for all, I found the need to create a bridge between these classes. “A medium of dialogue for all, a place of conversations that will rebrand the unity of purpose, to continue to build Nigeria, together. “In the year 2020, we began to open that channel of direct conversations between the Government and the Nigerian Citizens. From Parastatals to her Stakeholders, to States and their Citizens. “This channel, tagged, the G2C Interface (Government to Citizens Interface), has proven since then, that Nigerian people, home and abroad, are deeply interested in making contributions to the development and well-being of their Nation. “We do not know it all! We can not know, first hand, what the experiences of Nigerians are, from Jalingo to Awka, from Ilesa to Maiduguri. Except as we create a stage where these experiences are shared and necessary actions are taken. “There are roles, to constructively criticize the government policies, there are roles for suggestions of better policies, better solutions, better ways to execute plans, and so on.” This drive, puts all hands on deck and\\xa0 has proven that Nigeria belongs to us all. Today, at this edition of G2C Interface, we have brought the Federal Inland Revenue Service to the table with the Nigerian people, especially, the Stakeholders in the Tax Field.', 'https://www.sunnewsonline.com/prudent-use-of-public-funds-ll-encourage-citizens-to-pay-taxes-firs/', 614, 75, 73, 25, 0.0, 'Neutral')\n",

Something that has to do with women cannot be halted. “Last year alone, 500 girls benefited directly from our girls’ power project. For women empowerment, 50 women benefitted. From them, we now have mentors and mentees programme where the empowerment continues. We provide financial literacy, business support and restocking where applicable depending on their areas of interest. “We distributed reusable sanitary towels last year. But, we have realised that even reusable sanitary towels cost money. So, we are teaching them how to make these reusable towels by themselves and even make a business out of them. “Some of the challenges we faced included the myths about what feminism is all about. Many saw feminism as women going against men which is not correct. Feminism is all about creating a conducive environment for women and girls to participate equally in building the society of our dream. “Fortunately, we have been able to overcome that barrier through the help of traditional and religious leaders in those communities where we are presently working.”, she said. Earlier, the Founder of Speak4Life Cancer Prevention Initiative, Ms.\\xa0Malextive Mimi Abeeikyaa remarked that “women\\xa0and girls face many challenges in our society. The adverse psychological, sexual and reproductive health consequences of violence against women and girls affect women at all stages of their life. “For example, early-set educational disadvantages not only represent the primary obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls, but down the line, they are also to blame for restricting access to higher education and even translate into limited opportunities for women in the labour market. “It is up to us to support and protect them. We need to work together to create a safe and supportive environment for all women and girls. We also need to stand up against discrimination and violence against women and girls. “We all can make a huge difference as we have a serious role to play in this as stakeholders of this great community”, she said.', 'https://www.sunnewsonline.com/sustainable-livelihood-speak4life-empowers-350-kaduna-girls-women/', 502, 98, 60, 27, -0.08, 'Bad News')\n",

It urged peaceful Plateau citizens to ignore those who are bent on causing disaffection for the PDP by peddling unfounded rumour due to the swelling popularity, acceptability and credibility of the Governorship Candidate, Barr. Caleb Mutfwang ahead of the 2023 elections. In a press statement issued on Saturday in Jos and signed by the Director of Media and Publicity, Atiku/Mutfwang Campaign Council, Hon. Yiljap Abraham described as “claver piece of nonsense” a statement issued by a faceless group that Mutfwang has dumped Jang and endorsed Atiku. He explained that Mutfwang is a round peg in a round hole, working with all critical stakeholders of the party in Plateau and Nigeria to ensure that Nigerians and Plateau people are out of the current quagmire. Abraham said Barr. Caleb Mutfwang has maintained the same position all through his private and public campaigns, that “5/5 is what Plateau PDP is campaigning for.” “The party has lined up and is solidly standing by, and promoting all its quality candidates from the House of Assembly right to the Presidency. “Sen. Jang remains a member of the PDP Bot of Trustees. He has not categorically told Plateau people and his party he is doing anti-party. And he will not. When the Atiku-Mutfwang Campaign Council was inaugurated, Sen Jang sent the former Minister of Water Resources, Hon. Sarah Ochepke with his unmistakable message: he is for all the PDP candidates\\xa0 in the election.” He noted that the “Caleb Mutfwang dumps God father” headline by the faceless group is simply a weak effort at shopping for relevance and should be treated with disdain and ignominy. Abraham said Mutfwang, PDP and Jang have gone beyond that point, adding that, “The point must still be made: Atiku is coming to Jos on Tuesday, December 13 for a grand rally; Atiku will win Plateau State.” He stated.', 'https://www.sunnewsonline.com/plateaull-deliver-pdp-5-5-says-atiku-mutfwang-campaign-council/', 345, 85, 56, 18, -0.08, 'Bad News')\n",

The group which is on a statewide mobilisation and sensitisation tour of the 57 local government areas (LGAs) and local council development areas (LCDAs) of Lagos State noted that the statewide rally on Lagos Historical National Voting Fortune, with the theme, ‘Political Evangelism: Raising Active Voters above 50 Per cent’ is geared towards educating voters on the need to vote at the 2023 general elections. Coordinator General of AGT, Dr. Abdulhakeem Adetugbobo, who spoke at the Ojodu local council development areas (LCDAs) edition of a mobilisation and sensitisation seminar vowed to change the electoral fortune of the state by increasing voters’participation in the state by 50 per cent. He noted that the statewide seminar had become necessary because many eligible voters in Lagos State do not vote at the election. He said, “We are going around the 57 LGAs and LCDAs, it is an evangelical seminar. We have realised that since 1999, the electoral fortune of Lagos State has been less than 25 per cent of the registered voters. Our research showed that many of the critical stakeholders do not come out to vote. “So, we are here to educate the people on why they should exercise their franchise. Here in Lagos State we are opportune to produce the presidential candidate of the largest party in Africa, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and we believe that the best thing we can do as a state is to mobilise the people for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. We started well by mobilising the people during the continuous voters registration exercise; you are aware that Lagos State accounted for the highest number of registrants of over seven million fresh registration. “We believe we should leverage on this so that Lagos State has the highest vote fortune across the country, that is why we are on this statewide seminar. “The seminar is also to encourage these new registrants to go and collect their permanent voters card (PVC), and also vote.” In her contribution, Alhaja Olusola Tokumo, APC chair in Ojodu LCDA, noted that apart from sensitising the people, the seminar is also geared towards convincing non-APC members on why they should support Asiwaju Bola Tinubu for the 2023 presidency. She said, “What we are doing is to sensitise the people, those in our party, those that love our party, those that sympathise with our party, and even those that are not in APC on why they should vote for Asiwaju Tinubu during the election. “Our support base cuts across all ethnic nationalities, you can see that the people here are of other ethnic groups, some are Arewa, some Igbo, some from South South. We also have market women and men, as well as those that do not belong to any political party, so we want to woo them to join us in the APC. We want to show them that the incoming president in 2023, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is capable. “This seminar is to sensitise the people here, and they will in turn go and sensitise abd mobilise other people to join us in supporting our dear leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for president in 2023.” One of the youth leaders, Musa AbdulFatai Adesina,said, “Our main objective of being here is to enlighten the people on the voting process and how the coming election is going to be.\\xa0 For those that don’t know it’s going to be a training to tell people the coming election is going to be different from the previous election we have had in the past, that is why we have gathered people here to come and learn more so we give them a little training.”', 'https://www.sunnewsonline.com/2023-group-sensitises-voters-drums-support-for-tinubu/', 650, 69, 70, 21, 0.0, 'Neutral')\n",
      "('FG, WHO deploy 82 core responders for emergency response in Nigeria', 'The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, has inaugurated the first batch of core responders to respond to emergencies within the first 24 to 48 hours of its occurrence.  At the graduation ceremony of the 82 core responders in Abuja on Friday, Ehanire said at least 100 emergencies occur across Africa per week, causing damage to health and economic systems.  The core responders were trained under the theme “Capacity Building, Learning and Training to On-Board the AVoHC Strengthening and Utilising Response Groups for Emergencies (SURGE) Team”.  According to Ehanire,\\xa0there are public health emergencies that are already running quietly in the country.  “So our responsibility and our mandate goes beyond public health emergencies, which we are fully in support of, but there are others.  “We are losing up to 50,000 women every year in childbirth and that is a huge emergency. We are losing over 900,000 children every year.  “According to reports, we have 6,000 people killed in road traffic accidents every year and 17,000 from accidents who are maimed, permanently disabled every year. All of these are serious emergencies.”  He, however, said that the SURGE initiative promotes availability of equipment, well equipped teams with everything streamlined to respond to emergencies within the specified time frame.  He said they would also fully align with the concept of the resilient and sustainable health system for improved health outcomes and Universal Health Coverage.  He referred to it as a wealth of information that could turn around the detection and response time for emergencies within Nigeria and beyond.  The WHO Country Representative in Nigeria, Dr Walter Molumbo, said the organisation is committed to strengthening regional and sub national capacity to prepare and respond to public health emergencies in an increasingly globalised, unionised and connected world.  He added that people always being on the move was giving rise to an amplifying threat of multiple infectious hazards, in addition to natural disasters, conflict, climate change and other emergencies.  He said that the programme was aimed at providing national and subnational Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) with key knowledge and tools needed to detect and effectively respond to public health emergencies as they occur. He explained that “the SURGE programme identified five countries among which Nigeria is being chosen and in Nigeria, we have six states that have been selected to kick-start this process.  “We will be able to scale up the SURGE in the six pilot states but also go beyond to make sure that the entire country benefits from this initiative.  “It\\xa0is our hope that the country will truly build on this to make sure that we put in place the capacities that are truly needed to respond to future outbreak.  “We look forward to leveraging on data and innovation to create a community of practice where other countries who learn from what will be happening in Nigeria use the workforce we are developing to support other countries in Africa during the worst emergencies.”  The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that \\xa0the six pilot states are Abia, Yobe, Kano, Lagos, Edo and the Federal Capital Territory.  Giving an overview of the programme, Dr Kumdisha Balami, the Field Epidemiologist of WHO, said that the initiative would build on existing infrastructure to put in place a well-organised \\xa0support system that would augment government capacity when needed.  This, she said, would be by incorporating lessons from COVID-19, Ebola and other health emergencies.  She, however, said that there are centres of excellence across the continent to support the flagship initiative.  “We have the Centre for Data, Innovation and Intelligence in Senegal, Workforce Development in Kenya, Research and Development and Genomic Surveillance in South Africa.  “So, our topic of presentation today is on the response plan initiative, which is the SURGE and we have proposed to deploy at least 3000 African core responders that will be ready for response within 24 to 48 hours in the event of an emergency.  “For Nigeria, we proposed 350 core volunteers that will support emergency response in the country. So, as for today, we have about 82 who are ready to deploy in Nigeria.”  Balami, however, said that a collaborative approach which includes all agencies, sectors, government, partners to be on board under the support response was required to guarantee the success of the initiative.

He, therefore, urged journalists not to hesitate in confirming any information or complaints from the police before publication, saying\\xa0“by the time you do that and professionally you are balancing your report. He urged journalists to synergise with the police for a peaceful and credible 2023 polls, while describing them as critical stakeholders in election management. “You are the watchdog of the society but you are our own mirror, please, don’t mirror us negatively,” he said. Bala, who assumed office as the CP in Abia barely one month ago, appealed to journalists to carry the police along “as we promise to carry you along”. He promised to run an open-door policy, saying that journalists would be engaged in all the political activities and operations of the command. He thanked journalists for their good coverage during the recent visit of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) to the state. “The IGP, out of his magnanimity even allocated some operational equipment, including vehicles to us just because of the way you professionally handled his visit,” he said. Earlier, the Chairman of Correspondents Chapel, Chief Obinna Ibe, said the visit was to officially welcome the CP as well as seek partnership with the command for the 2023 election. “We are here, we have helped other CPs before you to succeed and we are ready to work with you, for you to succeed as well,” Ibe pledged.

      "('Barbaric act in viral video not APC national chairman – Aide', '\\xa0Malam Nata’ala Mohammed, Personal Assistant on New Media to the National Chairman of APC, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, has debunked insinuations making round that the viral video of a man stripped naked at Lafia Emir’s palace was suspected to be Adamu.  In a telephone interview on Saturday in Keffi, Mohammed, said those making such allegations were not honest to themselves and were mischievous in character, adding, ”they are only seeking relevance.”  ” A viral video of a man that was stripped naked on Thursday, Dec. 8 at the Emir of Lafia’s palace, which was also insinuated and suspected to be the APC National Chairman is false.  ” It was the mere imagination of mischievous people who are unfamiliar with the physical looks of Sen.\\xa0 Abdullahi Adamu.  ” This unfortunate misplacement of the true physical look of the person of Adamu, is not in anyway to be linked to him,” Mohammed said.  Also, a pro-democracy group, A .A Sule Progressives Forum, has vehemently condemned the dastardly act that occurred to their Grand Patron, Alhaji Abubakar Giza, who holds the traditional title of Ciroman Giza.  The State Coordinator of the forum, Mr Jonathan Samuel described the incidence as barbaric and unbecoming.  He stated that Giza was an elder statesman and an APC stalwart who has been a very strong pillar of support to the government of Nasarawa State.  According to Samuel, Giza is a peace loving man, urging, ”the evil act done to him by some unscrupulous elements should not be played down.  ”The perpetrators of such dastardly act should be identified and brought to book to serve as a deterrent to others.”  He emphasized the need for all and sundry to be security conscious at all times, saying, ”these bad eggs are lurking everywhere.”  Samuel also urged the security agencies to intensify efforts in apprehending the culprits.
