0, ‘APC plans to disunite Nigerians with Muslim/Muslim ticket’  ,"A former Board of Trustees Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party  Senator Walid Jibrin, has accused the All Progressives Congress of planning to disunite Nigerians with its Muslim/Muslim Ticket ahead of the 2023 general elections. Jibrin who is the Chairman of the PDP presidential and governorship campaign council in Nasarawa State made the accusation in the Awe Local Government Area of the state during his party’s zonal campaign rally on Thursday. Our correspondent reports that the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, a Muslim, had picked the former governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, who is also a Muslim as his running mate ahead of the poll. The development caused discontent along religious lines as many Christian faithful protested what they referred to as an attempt to “Islamise” the country. The action of the APC also forced some stakeholders of the Christian faith out of the party. Senator Jibrin said, “That singular unpatriotic gesture, coming at a time of rising security challenges confronting the nation is never a welcome development. “The apparent late excuses by Tinubu to justify what is clearly an anomaly, that his wife is a Pentecostal pastor, are lame and insulting to the sensibility of Nigerians.

He appealed to residents of the state to vote for all PDP candidates in the 2023 elections, promising that the party would tackle the numerous challenges confronting the nation by providing the dividends of democracy to the people. On the current disagreement between the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and the Governor of Rivers state, Nyesom Wike, the former Board of Trustees Chairman said leaders of the party were making frantic efforts to settle the disputes before the commencement of the 2023 elections. “What is happening now in the PDP is a family matter. Alhaji Atiku and Governor Wike are brothers. As leaders, we are making efforts to address the issues, and we are hopeful that they will be resolved before the February 2023 elections. “I stepped down from my position as BoT chairman to allow peace to reign in the party and pave way for other party stakeholders who had never occupied my former position to do so. “I am confident that the PDP will retake the presidency and win many states during the forthcoming elections, so I am urging our party members and supporters to remain resolute in the struggle,” Walid Jibrin added.",2nd December 2022,Collins Sunday,"""https://punchng.com/apc-plans-to-disunite-nigerians-with-muslim-muslim-ticket/""",502,102,57,16,-0.09,Bad News

2," Oyetola, Adeleke disagree over N76bn unpaid salaries, pensions  ","The Osun State Government has said the immediate past administration left a debt portfolio of N76bn in unpaid salaries  pensions, and insurance commitments. A statement by the spokesperson for the governor, Olawale Rasheed, obtained in Osogbo on Thursday, said the figure was given by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Mrs Bimpe Ogunlumade, while briefing officials of the new administration on the financial status of the state. The statement read in part, “The breakdown of the salaries and pension-related liabilities as disclosed by the permanent secretary are as follows: Salary: N29,875,191,128.64; Pension Arrears: N45,375,237,693.40; and Group Life Assurance Scheme: N554,644,028.97; giving a total of N75,805,072,851.01.” It further said the disclosure was contrary to the claim by the ex-governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, that he left a sum of N14bn in cash for the new government. The state government stated that the figure was not the total debt left by the past administration, as briefings on other sources of liabilities had not been completed.

However, while reacting, Ismail Omipidan, the media aide to the former governor said the administration did not owe salaries. Omipidan said, “For the umpteenth time, let me place it on record that for four years, we did not owe a dime in salary payments, while we made conscious efforts to reduce the backlog of pensions and gratuities we inherited. “This also explains why there hasn’t been a strike in four years. According to their calculations, we owed salaries for nearly a year. Is that possible? The labour union can also attest that we never left any salary unpaid during our tenure, and we did not take out any bank loans for four years.”",2nd December 2022,Bola Bamigbola,"""https://punchng.com/oyetola-adeleke-disagree-over-n76bn-unpaid-salaries-pensions/""",397,73,32,19,-0.1,Bad News

Speaking to journalists after the protest, the UNIZIK ASUU Chairman, Stephen Ufoaroh, said,  “As I speak to you, the intervention of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has not yielded any positive result. “We are using this protest to ask the masses to appeal to the Federal Government to do the needful now to avert further crisis in the nation’s universities.” The Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof. Charles Esimone, in his solidarity message, said his heart was bleeding because of the deplorable conditions under which lecturers were working in the country.

12,"  NASS clerk appointment crisis worsens, workers issue ultimatum  ","The legitimacy of having two occupants in the Office of the Clerk to the National Assembly is currently the subject of controversial discussion  The PUNCH has learnt. The National Assembly Service Commission has already been granted one week by federal parliament workers to choose the substantive Clerk for the National Assembly. Several senior officials of the National Assembly told The PUNCH in different interviews that the crisis would be prolonged by the division created in the bureaucracy allegedly by the NASC, with the appointment of the Secretary of Finance and Accounts, Sani Tambuwal, as the acting Clerk of the National Assembly, when the outgoing Clerk, Amos Ojo, had not retired. The PUNCH reports that the crisis began when Ojo, who was billed to proceed on a three-month pre-retirement leave on November 14, 2022, and retire from service on February 14, 2023, opted to shelve the terminal leave and remain in service until retirement. Later in November, the NASC appointed Tambuwal as Acting Clerk, while the Secretary of Legal Services, Kamoru Ogunlana, was also appointed as the Acting Deputy Clerk. The Chairman of the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria, National Assembly chapter, Sunday Sabiyi, faulted the actions of the NASC. Sabiyi said, “We have never had two clerks. Can you have two captains on a ship? So many clerks have gone on retirement. One clerk went six months before retirement.

But to us, we know they have violated the Act; they have violated Section 7 of the Constitution, which clearly spells out how clerks should be appointed in the National Assembly. If you check the Civil Service Rules again, you will see it there. You cannot have an acting clerk while the person (departing clerk) is still present. But if that person is on a retirement leave, he should go while another person continues. He should come and hand over when he finally retires.” On Wednesday night, PASAN issued a seven-day deadline to the NASC to determine the authentic clerk of the National Assembly. The letter, addressed to NASC Chairman Ahmed Amshi, was signed and dated November 30, 2022, by Secretary-General Awobita Hammed. The Director of Information for the National Assembly, Rawlings Agada, said the management recognised the powers of the NASC regarding workers. Asked if there were indeed two clerks at the National Assembly, Agada said, “There cannot be two kings in a palace. Anything that has to do with appointment, promotion, discipline, or condition of service is with the National Assembly Service Commission. “This issue we are dealing with now, ordinarily, that is how it should be. The commission made the appointment; the President of the Senate or the Speaker does not have the legal authority to issue a clear directive on any issue. Whatever the Senate President said was advisory to the chairman (of NASC). He wrote to the chairman of the commission, stating reasons why he thought the former CNA should be allowed to come in.

17, Nigeria needs good leaders not restructuring – Ex-lawmaker  ,"A former member of the House of Representatives  Bimbo Daramola, has said Nigerians are mistaking the leadership challenges confronting the country for structural challenges, hence the call for restructuring. Daramola, who is seeking a return to the House in 2023 on the platform of the Social Democratic Party, Ekiti North Federal (Oye/Ikole) Constituency 1, said what Nigeria needed urgently was to fix the leadership crisis rocking it, following which all things would fall in place. The SDP candidate, who spoke in Ado Ekiti on Saturday during a chat with journalists, said he was back in the race “because of young people who believe in what I represent. I expect that this is another election that will show the way in this country. Nigerians should take a stand for the right people. It is up to us to liberate our people.” The former lawmaker condemned vote-buying, describing vote-buyers as “exploiters,” saying, “That is why those elected leaders behave anyhow because nobody will ask them questions after the transaction. “Vote-buying as a phenomenon is a threat to our democracy. There is no doubt about that because it compromises people, it takes advantage of the weak, poor and less-privileged. Vote-buying can’t stop unemployment and hunger after elections. If we abdicate responsibility, then all of us are going to pay the price and I hope that does not happen,” he said.

Let us fix our leadership challenges and problems, then we can fix all other problems. “A man who is corrupt in Nigeria, when he gets to the Republic of Oduduwa will be a mega corrupt man.

18, Lawyer sues military over arrest of Delta residents  ,"A Warri-based lawyer  Choice Umode, has dragged the Nigerian Army together with the Commanding Officer of the 90 Amphibious Battalion, Major Ajongbo, to a Delta State High Court, Effurun in Uvwie Local Government Area of the state. The lawyer is demanding N20m each for the three persons who were allegedly arrested and detained unlawfully for over three weeks by military men attached to the Nigerian Army 90 Battalion in Koko, Warri North LGA. In a motion on Notice with Suit No: EHC/FHR/92/2022 before the court, the lawyer noted that “the N20m is for exemplary and general damages suffered psychologically, physically and emotionally by the victims” for their unlawful detention by the Nigerian Army since November 9, 2022. The lawyer listed the three persons allegedly arrested and detained unlawfully by the Army as Abraham Asagba, brother to a businessman; Goodluck Ikoyo, Chairman of Ikweawu Community, Amu-Okpe in Sapele LGA and one Mr. Igho Meeting. The lawyer claimed the trio was arrested and had been in military detention for the past three weeks till date without the order of any court of competent jurisdiction. While seeking redress against the alleged infringement of the fundamental rights of his clients, the lawyer is also seeking from the court a declaration that the arrest and detention of the applicants since November 9, 2022, by military officers of the first respondent under the control and supervision of the second respondent “is unconstitutional and illegal.” Another relief being sought is a declaration that “the detention of the applicants in the military cell for over 22 days is unconstitutional and illegal.” PUNCH Metro gathered that the lawyer had earlier petitioned the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Ari Muhammed Ali, and the General Officer, Commanding, 6 Division of Nigerian Army in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State, respectively, over the matter, before eventually approaching the Delta High Court for adjudication. Related News  Auto crash claims three in Delta, others injured  Gunmen attack Delta mosque, 11 injured  Delta father kills daughter for entering neighbour’s room The lawyer alleged that the applicants had been unilaterally kept in the custody of the 63 Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Asaba, Delta State, since November 9, 2022. In the petition, the legal practitioner claimed that the trio of Mr. Abraham Asagba, Mr. Goodluck Ikoyo and one Mr. Igho Meeting, a worker in a dredging site owned by a businessman, were allegedly arrested by the military officers and had been in detention for the past three weeks till date without the order of any court of competent jurisdiction. While noting that the businessman does dredging of sand at Ikweawu Community, Amu-Okpe, in Sapele LGA, the lawyer claimed that one Stephen, a security guard in his dredging site called him on phone to inform him that some armed men came to the dredging site to rob and that he should rush down to the site immediately. Consequently, the businessman was said to have directed his elder brother, Abraham Asagba, Goodluck Ikoyo and Igho Meeting to go to the dredging site on the information received from Stephen. But while the trio was on their way to the dredging site following the prompting of the businessman, they were reportedly accosted by some military officers attached to the 90 Battalion of the Nigerian Army who arrested and detained them under the custody of the 63 Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Asaba, Delta. The lawyer maintained that “frantic efforts made by the businessman and family members to, at least, have access to the arrested persons had proven abortive.” When contacted for comments on the matter, the Police Public Relations Officer for Delta State Command, DSP Bright Edafe, said he was not aware of such a petition. Also, efforts to reach the Commanding Officer of the 6 Division, Port-Harcourt in Rivers State were unsuccessful as of the time of filing this report.",4th December 2022,Dele Ogunyemi,"""https://punchng.com/lawyer-sues-military-over-arrest-of-delta-residents/""",639,111,57,20,-0.08,Bad News
19," Rufai: Ogun govt refutes $50,000 payment allegation  ","The Ogun State government on Sunday denied that it paid the convicted fraudster who was Special Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties  Bidemi Rufai “$50,000” per deal as a state appointee. The government also denied that Rufai brought business concerns to the state during his short stint as a special assistant to the state Governor, Dapo Abiodun. An online media had reported that prior to his arrest and conviction in the United States, Rufai was in August 2020 appointed senior special assistant on special duties by governor Abiodun. In May 2021, Rufai was apprehended by U.S. security officials at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport while returning to Nigeria. The online also reported that the court documents listed that on May 26, 2021, he was indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, nine counts of wire fraud and five counts of aggravated identity theft. According to the report, a  Washington Post report states that Abiodun was paying Rufai $2,000 as his official salary as well as the $50,000 cut meant for “introducing people” to him. But, refuting the allegations, the state government also debunked a news report that Rufai was being paid $2,000 as an aide to the governor. A statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Kunle Somorin, on Sunday,  said Rufai, who was appointed by the governor as his Senior Special Assistant on Housing, never had any close relationship with the governor, prior to his appointment. According to Somorin, Rufai, like other aides of the governor, was recommended from his ward for the appointment, and not because of any special favour he offered to the governor during his gubernatorial campaigns in 2019. The statement further faulted and denied the claims by the online medium that Rufai was being paid a $2,000 salary, which according to it is “outrageous and baseless.” The statement read, “salaries and wages of political office holders are fixed by the National Salaries, Income and Wages Commission, adding that no member of the government is permitted to any other allowances not known to law. Related News  Ogun partners World Bank on access to agricultural land  World Bank, agency collaborate to repair Ogun roads  South-West devt: Ogun govt advocates digital connectivity, others “Records in the state never showed that Rufai, while serving in the state, brought a single investor or facilitated any investment from the United States of America, wondering how the former political aide would then be paid $50,000 for a deal that never took place. “Bidemi Rufai was appointed as a Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Housing and was nominated for appointment barely three months before he was arrested. “He had not resumed formerly and had no official office to transact business. He wasn’t part of the Ogun State Economic Management Team and have got no input into the state government activities. His appointment was based on his activities in his ward. He didn’t sit in the State Executive Council meetings and couldn’t have had inputs in policies of the state government. “The governor had no deal with Rufai on any transaction. He brought not a single one. They can check with the US embassy.” Somorin noted further that Governor Abiodun being a law-abiding person and respecter of the rule of law, immediately suspended Rufai after his arrest for fraud in the United States and later terminated his appointment, even before his conviction for the crime by the US court. He noted that the current political season in the country is an auspicious time for unscrupulous politicians to attack or sponsor attacks against their opponents, hence, the timing of the concocted story. He said that the political enemies of the governor, who are perhaps not happy with his rising profile, particularly in terms of the huge foreign investment drive and infrastructural development in Ogun State, might want to play up the issue of Rufai to tarnish his image. Somorin, while calling on the people of the state to disregard the report as a mere “attention seeking” gambit, said that Governor Abiodun would rather not be perturbed by the report, but remain focussed on his mission to position Ogun as the number one investors’ preferred destination in the country. He added that  Abiodun would not be distracted by the antics of political traducers in and outside Ogun, submitting that the governor will continue to be just, fair, accountable and equitable in the distribution of amenities across the state. He also warned journalists, especially online to beware of their eminent roles in society and guide against succumbing to bread-and butter-journalism.",4th December 2022,Daud Olatunji,"""https://punchng.com/rufai-ogun-govt-refutes-50000-payment-allegation/""",763,112,82,29,-0.04,Bad News

22,Debate: How state-LG funding crisis began - Atiku  ,"The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party  Atiku Abubakar, has shed light on the crisis rocking the disbursement of funds from the Federal Government and how such funds were being managed between states and their local government authorities. Atiku said the problem began while he was serving as the Vice President of the country, saying he headed the local government administration where he had ensured that local government funds were transferred directly to the local government accounts. Atiku who spoke at the ongoing presidential town hall series 3, organised by Arise News on Sunday,  stated that the policy he enacted was protested by the then governors who noted it wasn’t constitutional. Atiku said, “When I assumed office in 1999, what was handed over to me was the local government administration and when it was handed over to me, I gave instructions to the Accountant General that all local government allocations should be transferred to the local governments straight. After implementing that policy for nine months, the governors protested that that was not constitutional. “So we looked at the constitution, and they said there was supposed to be a joint account at the state level where local government funds should be transferred and also the state government was supposed to put a certain percentage of their revenue into that account, and it (the local government funds) was then moved to that joint account. “Then, the local governments started getting their funding through the state joint accounts and that is where we have problems. In that process, some state governments started taking part of the local government finances. Some said they were going to run universities with the state governments, some said local governments should contribute to certain projects in the state. At the end of the day, the funds were being depleted and the local governments were left with no funding, and in fact, it has gone to virtually nothing now. Atiku said it was necessary to look at the constitution to see how the local governments could be made independent as far as their revenues and finances were concerned.

The campaign is intended to sustain the peace in the region by sensitising youths especially secondary school students to the dangers of cultism and drug abuse. Speaking during the one-day campaign in Uyo on Saturday  the acting Managing Director of the Commission, Emmanuel Audu-Ohwavborua, said the two vices had eaten deep into society and destroyed the promising future of the young generation. Audu-Ohwavboua, who was represented by the Director of Youths and Sports, NDDC, Offiong Ephraim, urged the youths to flee from the twin problems of cultism and drug abuse to enable them contribute to development.

30,  Adeleke's allegations of looting against Oyetola unfair - ex-Commissioner  ,"The immediate past administration in Osun State led by Mr Adegboyega Oyetola has described the allegation of looting of government property  by the incumbent governor, Senator Ademola Adeleke, against it as unfair and shameful. Oyetola’s administration was reacting to the videos released in which the new government claimed items were missing in the Government House and quarters of some former political appointees. But a statement signed by the former Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode, Oyetola administration said the allegation was tantamount to a failed attempt by Adeleke to soil the name and good governance established by the former helmsman of the state. The statement read in parts, “We have seen the very laughable and shameless claims by the government of the day about the Government House being looted by the previous administration. The extent they have gone to peddle their falsehood is so preposterous that discerning minds are beginning to ask how a governor who completely renovated the Governor’s Lodge in June will stoop so low as to empty the First Aid box in the lodge. “Accusing a man of Oyetola’s pedigree of taking away a government house cooker and emptying bottles of methylated spirit takes away a lot from the accuser. It is beyond laughable, really.

Mr Komolafe, in the letter, asked for armed security to stop the looting in the Okefia GRA, Government House.” “So, how exactly is Mr Oyetola guilty of this looting by ‘unknown men’ after he had vacated Government House?

32,"  'Nigeria needs 12,000 doctors annually to meet medical conditions'  ","The Medical and Dental Consultants’ Association of Nigeria has said to meet the required number of doctors in the country  it is estimated that the country produces about 12,000 doctors every year. This was contained in a press statement signed by the association’s President, Dr Victor Makanjuola, and made available to our correspondent. He said a survey carried out in March 2022, by the association’s Medical Education Committee found that over 500 medical and dental consultants had left Nigeria for more developed countries over the preceding two years. He, however, said it will hold a one-day summit in Abuja on December 6, with the possibility of birthing a turning point in medical education in Nigeria. The statement read in part “Disturbed by the impact of this ugly trend on our country’s health sector growth and development, the MDCAN has conducted a survey amongst its chapters in March 2022 and found that over 500 medical and dental consultants had left Nigeria for more developed countries over the preceding two years. Related News  Nigeria, Benin Republic collaborate to foster unity  Firm wins at Nigerian Fintech Awards  2023: Nigeria disunited, says SAN “A further exploration of data by the Association’s Medical Education Committee showed that 9 out of every 10 medical and dental consultants with less than five years experience on the job had plans to leave the country. Furthermore, the Nigerian Medical Association recently reported that only 24,000 doctors are currently registered to practice in Nigeria, giving a ratio of one doctor to over 8,000 Nigerians, against the World Health Organisation’s recommended ratio of one doctor to every 600 people. “It is important to note that the average medical and dental consultant is not only a clinician but also doubles as the teacher for medical students and doctors in specialist (residency) training. It, therefore, goes without saying that the loss of this category of highly skilled workforce to other countries will not only have an immediate negative impact on clinical service delivery but will leave a long-term, devastating impact on the training of future doctors in Nigeria. “Anecdotal projections indicate that the 3,000 fresh medical and dental doctors, on average, produced by our local medical schools in Nigeria and another 1,000 produced by foreign medical schools, fall far short of the number of such healthcare personnel required to meet the country’s yearly new medical manpower supply needs, estimated to fall between 10,000 and 12,000 (about three times the current rate), according to the National Postgraduate Medical College. As a concerned stakeholder, we resolved to kickstart this necessary but difficult conversation that seeks to help the country in shaping the future of medical education in Nigeria in the hope of meeting the human resources needs of our national health system.” He added that leaders of thought in the medical profession as well as seasoned educators and administrators of medical training institutions will speak at the summit. “While we continue to urge the Government to improve the conditions of service and other ‘push’ factors, we consider this as an opportunity to rethink the philosophy and principles governing medical education in Nigeria,” he said.",4th December 2022,Lara Adejoro,"""https://punchng.com/nigeria-needs-12000-doctors-annually-to-meet-medical-conditions/""",519,83,65,13,-0.03,Bad News

The beneficiary students were drawn from The Kaduna State University,  College of Education, Kafanchan, Federal College of Education, Zaria and Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria, all in the state. The governorship hopeful, who’s also the incumbent senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District, said he went a notch further to explore funding avenues for students who were confronted by current financial difficulties associated with school fees. Sani, “I had the privilege and honour of handing over scholarship grants to hundreds of indigent yet brilliant students in the following tertiary institutions; Kaduna State University, College of Education, Kafanchan, Federal College of Education, Zaria and Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria. “I facilitated the financial intervention  to create opportunity for the teeming students of Kaduna State who cannot afford to pay their school fees.” While reiterating  the importance of education at the event, Sani said the scholarship was “the only thing we can give the children of the underprivileged to compete with that of the rich,” adding that education is “the greatest leveller.” This was just as the lawmaker while speaking at a media parley held at the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Kaduna State Council in the state capital, on Saturday, said he would continue from where Malam Nasir El-rufai stopped in administering the state if elected governor in 2023.

37,  Liberian President slammed for long stay abroad&nbsp;  ,"Liberian President George Weah’s long absence from the country has raised eyebrows and prompted criticism  leading one opposition figure to ask if the West African nation is running on “autopilot.” Weah went abroad at the end of October for a string of political gatherings in numerous countries– and to watch his footballer son represent the United States at the World Cup in Qatar. Since then, the President – himself a former football star – has not been seen in his homeland where people are battling soaring prices and shortages of basic goods. Even those with an understanding of the demands of top-flight diplomacy, or the enduring love of the beautiful game, are beginning to wonder. Weah has shared pictures and video of himself with his son in Qatar on Twitter, speaking of being a “proud daddy” as the US national team qualified for the knockout stages. But images of Weah enjoying himself in the stands in Qatar – where he is a “guest of honour” – while Liberians struggle have not gone down well with many compatriots venting their anger on social media. “This one here has passed the limit now… who (has) he left us with?” 23-year-old Abraham Kaneh told AFP in the capital Monrovia. “He’s not going to do the work of the Liberian people. He went to do the work of his own son. He did not go on our plea, he’s gone to see other friends,” said fellow Monrovian Momo Fully. Well-known media personality Henry Costa joked online that the president would extend his absence to January if his son Timothy scored against England last month. – ‘Abandoning the entire country’ – New York-born Timothy Weah is one of many people to hold US and Liberian nationality, with the countries maintaining close ties dating back to Americans’ role in the creation of the West African state in the 19th century. Plenty of football-loving Liberians follow the younger Weah’s performances for his French club Lille, but for opposition politician Lewis Browne that does not justify the president’s globe-trotting activities. “Weah continues to insult the intelligence of Liberians and exhibit a high degree of don’t-care attitude by abandoning the entire country and citizens to witness soccer matches,” he said. Related News  Buhari promises free, fair elections in Liberia, S’Leone  Liberia seizes $100m worth of cocaine  West Africa needs credible elections - Buhari Browne also accused Weah of misusing public money to lead a celebrity lifestyle. The opposition has also condemned what it sees as the president’s gallivanting between Qatar and international summits in Morocco, Egypt, France, Monaco and the United States, with former vice president Joseph Boakai saying Liberia was “on autopilot”. “We continue to witness other acts of poor leadership, irresponsible behaviour, lack of concern, impunity, and wanton misuse of our finances,” the Unity Party heavyweight added, suggesting others could have represented the country in Weah’s place. – A ‘necessary’ absence – Other Liberians defended Weah, who acquired iconic status after becoming the first and only African to win football’s most prestigious individual award, the Ballon d’Or, in 1995. “I support the president. The man wants to see his son playing, what’s wrong with that?” Alex Bono, 31, told AFP. Entrepreneur Antoinette Anderson praised Weah for “trying to render services to the Liberian people” and “gather funds out there to make Liberia a better place to live”. “I don’t have problems with the events he went on. The fact he went there on behalf of the country, I think it’s necessary,” added Tarlue Zeyon in Monrovia. Weah last month extended his stint abroad, the longest since he became president, by another 25 days and is due back in Liberia on December 18. His government is also facing criticism over its handling of a census that must take place before elections in 2023. Weah, who came to power in 2017 on a pledge to fight poverty and corruption, has been chosen by his party to seek re-election, but critics say he has failed to honour his commitments.

39,  Floods: SERAP sues Buhari over ‘missing ecological funds’  ,"Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari over “the failure to probe the spending of trillions of ecological funds by governments at all levels—federal  state and local governments from 2001 to date, and to ensure the prosecution of suspected perpetrators of corruption and mismanagement of public funds.” Joined in the suit as Respondents are the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha. The United Nations Children’s Fund recently said that no fewer than 600 persons died and 1.3 million were rendered homeless as a result of the floods that ravaged most states across the country, with the destruction of properties worth billions. In the suit number FHC/L/CS/2283/2022 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court, Lagos, SERAP is asking the court to “direct and compel President Buhari to promptly and thoroughly investigate the spending of Ecological Fund by governments at the Federal, state and local government levels from 2001 to date.” SERAP is also asking the court to “direct and compel President Buhari to ensure that suspected perpetrators of corruption and mismanagement of trillions of ecological funds are promptly brought to justice, and any missing public funds fully recovered.” In the suit, SERAP is arguing that “the failure to probe the alleged missing trillions, prosecute suspected perpetrators and recover any missing public funds is a fundamental breach of constitutional and international legal obligations.” SERAP is also arguing that “impunity for corruption in the management of Ecological Fund will continue as long as high-ranking public officials go largely unpunished for their alleged crimes.” According to SERAP, “It is in the public interest to direct and compel President Buhari to probe these allegations so that evidence can be taken before the court and the truth about the spending of ecological funds revealed, and justice served.” SERAP is also arguing that “the Federal Government has violated the obligations to protect and uphold the human rights of those affected, and to provide them with access to justice and effective remedies.” The suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyer Kolawole Oluwadare read in part: “the Federal Government has the legal obligations to address the calamitous consequences of flooding for the human rights of millions of people, and to prevent and address the consequences that climate change may reap on human rights.” “According to the audit of the Ecological Fund Office carried out by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the total amount received by the fund from December 2011 to November 2016 alone was N277 billion.” “The operations of the Fund from 2012 to 2016 reportedly showed that some of the disbursements were not utilised for the purpose for which it was established. During these periods, N74,170,932,645.20 was released to State Governments to solve ecological problems in their States.” Related News  Reps lament hitches on ecological fund’s probe  Illegal pipelines: SERAP drags FG to ECOWAS court  Poverty: Probe 'social intervention programmes', SERAP tells Buhari “Although ecological funds are shared across the three tiers of government, and emergency management agencies, the funds are managed and supervised by the Federal Government.” “The Federal Government has the legal obligations to prevent and address the threats to human rights that result from climate change, and to provide access to justice and effective remedies for victims when these rights are violated.” “The Federal Government has a positive obligation to protect individuals against the threat posed to human rights by climate change, regardless of the causes, and to effectively address the aftermath of the flooding such as deterioration in health, diminishing access to safe drinking water and susceptibility to disease.” “Climate change also has the potential to exacerbate existing threats to human rights in the country.

42,"  Osun people proud of Adeleke's approach, actions - Lawyer  ","A human rights lawyer  Pelumi Olajengbesi, has commended the Governor of Osun State, Ademola Adeleke for rescinding the appointments and other actions taken by his predecessor, Gboyega Oyetola, after his defeat at the Osun State governorship election on July 16, 2022. The lawyer claimed that the people were proud of Adeleke’s approach to governance and actions taken in the few days he got to the office. The lawyer, in a statement on Saturday, said public officeholders must learn to act constitutionally regardless of whether or not they lose an election. He also tagged Oyetola’s actions as an “abuse of power because it violates the law”. The PUNCH reports that Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party defeated the then-incumbent Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress at the July 16, 2022 poll, winning 17 local government areas of the 30 local council areas in the state. Following his defeat, Oyetola conducted local government elections on October 15 through the Osun State Independent Electoral Commission, which was later nullified by a Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo because it contravened Sections 29 & 32 of the Electoral Act, 2022. Also, days before the end of his tenure in November, Oyetola named 30 public servants as Permanent Secretaries, amongst other appointments.

It is not an easy task but one that only a dogged and courageous fighter and democrat can face. “Having said that, the good people of Osun State are proud of the actions of Senator Adeleke in the few days that he was sworn into office since November 27, 2022. From the freeze of all government accounts to the reversal of the state’s name from the State of Osun to Osun State, the suspension of monarchs hastily appointed by Oyetola after his defeat, the sacking of the chairman of the Osun electoral commission, the order directing all former appointees under Oyetola to return government properties, amongst others. All these steps are laudable and show that Governor Adeleke is one that cherish accountability and justice. “Perspective must be properly set that Oyetola flagrantly acted in contravention of the constitution through his spurious and selfish appointments towards the dusk of his ill-fated administration. “In fact, the seeming aggression in the starting of Adeleke Government is simply because Oyetola and his administration did not cooperate with the 37-member Transition Committee set up by Senator Adeleke after the PDP governorship candidate’s victory. No report was handed over to the now governor of the state by the Oyetola government. Oyetola demonstrated hostility, political bitterness and intolerance by not cooperating with Senator Adeleke through an adequate handover process. “One must encourage Senator Adeleke to continue his firm grip on the draconian laws and policies of the Oyetola government. Democracy should be about yielding dividends to the people and not a few people enriching themselves through spurious appointments of their cronies.

45,"  Don’t blame us, you failed Nigerians, govs reply FG  ","Governors of the 36 states have accused the Federal Government of abandoning its duty of addressing the security challenges crippling economic activities in the country. The governors  under the auspices of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, said the rising level of poverty among Nigerians was a consequence of the biting effect of insecurity on commercial and agricultural activities. They also alleged that the Federal Government’s inaction had allowed “bandits, insurgents, and kidnappers to turn the country into a killing field”. While reacting to the claim by the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clement Agba, that the 36 governors were responsible for the rising poverty index in the country, the forum argued that the governors had made tremendous progress in their respective states through relevant projects. The NGF, in a statement by its Director of Media and Public Affairs, AbdulRazaque Bello-Barkindo, said, “It is important to put on record the progress made by state governors in the administration of their states, which have witnessed tremendous progress in recent times. Governors have undertaken projects where they, in conjunction with their people, deem them fit for purpose. “This dereliction of duty from the center is the main reason why people have been unable to engage in regular agrarian activity and commerce. Today, rural areas are insecure, markets are unsafe, travel surety is improbable and life for the common people generally is harsh and brutish. “The opinion, therefore, of one minister, based on a survey of 56,000 households in a country of 200 million people can never diminish the good work that 36 pro-poor-minded governors are doing for this country.” It further accused the minister of attempting to defray the notion that rising levels of hunger and lack were peculiar to Nigeria, instead of responding to a question demanding to know what he and his colleague, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, were doing to ameliorate the hardship Nigerians were facing. “Mr Agba explained that their government, through many of its social security programs, has been dedicating resources to alleviating hardship, and then goes further to accuse state governors of misdirecting resources to projects that have no impact on the people. While rightly pointing out that 72 per cent of the poverty in Nigeria is found in the rural areas, the minister said that the rural populace had been abandoned by governors,” the statement added. The forum also described the Federal Government’s claim as “Mr Agba’s veiled and deliberate effort, as a minister, to protect his paymasters and politicise very critical issues of national importance”. The statement further added, “The primary duty of any government is to ensure the security of lives and property, without which no sensible human activity takes place. But the Federal Government, which is responsible for the security of lives and property, has been unable to fulfil this covenant with the people, thus allowing bandits, insurgents, and kidnappers to turn the country into a killing field, maiming and abducting people, in schools market squares and even on their farmlands. “How can a defenceless rural population maintain a sustainable lifestyle of peace and harmony when their lives are cut prematurely, and they wallow permanently in danger? How does a minister whose government has been unable to ensure security, law, and order have the temerity to blame governors?

The situation had compelled governors to rely on other sources of revenue like the SFTAS program and other interventions anchored by the NGF, to fund state activities while monies budgeted for such federal ministries like agriculture, rural development, and humanitarian affairs, are not being deployed in the direction of the people.” Akeredolu replies FG Similarly, the Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, has denied tampering with funds belonging to the local government areas in the state. Akeredolu stated this while reacting to the allegation by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), accusing governors of stealing local government funds. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, on Saturday, the governor said his administration had not touched funds meant for local governments since its inception. He also said his administration did receive 13 per cent oil derivation, subsidy, and SURE-P refunds from the federation account in the last two years of 2021 and 2022, explaining that the refunds received from the Federal Government were judiciously expended on some key capital projects across the three senatorial districts of the state. The statement added, “As a matter of policy, monies meant for local governments are shared at their monthly Joint Account Allocation Committee. Mr Governor doesn’t touch local government funds. The local government chairmen can attest to the fact that they have total freedom in the management of their funds. “The monthly FAAC receipts are devoted to the payment of salaries and pensions as agreed by labour leaders at the monthly meetings presided over by the Head of Service and Chairman of Joint Negotiating Council. Despite Governor Akeredolu’s vow to always pay salaries and pensions as and when due, the financial crisis across the country occasioned by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in non-payment of salaries in full for some months. As of January 2022, the government owed four months’ salary arrears as against the seven months inherited. “Governor Akeredolu, having promised the civil servants in the state to prioritise payment of salaries, has continued to clear these backlogs of arrears. On three occasions this year, the government has paid double salaries in a month, thereby reducing the arrears. All salaries will be cleared before the year ends. “If the amount expended on these infrastructural projects and payment of salary arrears is juxtaposed with the refunds, it is crystal clear that the monies were not mismanaged in Ondo State. “The administration of Governor Akeredolu stands on the tripod of transparency, accountability, and integrity.

46,"  Ex-govs on life pension live in  luxury, retirees languish in penury  ","BLESSING AFOLABI writes about the plight of pensioners  struggling to access their entitlements after about 35 years of service Decked in black attire like mourners, tens of aggrieved, hungry-looking, aged retirees congregated in front of the Delta State Government House, on Monday, November 28, 2022, holding placards. The placards had various inscriptions: “Wicked Okowa, pay us our pensions”; “Okowa, fear God and pay our money, retirees are suffering” and “Okowa, you owe the living and the dead”, among others. The senior citizens from primary schools across 25 local government areas of the state, with frustration etched all over their faces, sat on mats and the bare ground, hindering vehicular movement to and fro the government house whilst they displayed the medications they lived on daily. They vowed aloud to remain there until the governor addressed them in person. One of the retirees, Patrick Lori, told our correspondent that pensioners in the state were being owed since 2015 despite serving meritoriously for 35 years, hence the protest. The Delta case is not an isolated one. Across different states in Nigeria, pensioners are having hard times and are increasingly taking to the streets in protest, chanting anti-government songs to register their grievances. On October 6, 2022, hundreds of distressed pensioners in Kano State marched from the Audu Bako Secretariat to the state’s Government House, peacefully protesting the non-payment of their accumulated entitlements totalling N30.9bn. In the course of the protest, there were reports that one of the pensioners collapsed out of exhaustion. Their colleagues in Imo, Niger, Anambra, Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Calabar, and Ogun states have followed suit in protests. In January this year, pensioners in Ekiti State went spiritual after several protests to make the government clear their backlog of unpaid pension running into N1.8bn yielded no result. The chairman of the Nigerian Union of Pensioners in the state, Mr Joel Akinola, who spoke during the special prayer session in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, where some of the pensioners betrayed emotions and burst into tears, lamented that the state government had abandoned them despite investing their active years into civil service. The NUP Secretary, Azeez Agbaje, said the pensioners decided to change tactics by resorting to fasting and prayers to God, so He could touch the heart of the governor to pay them their entitlements. “One with God is a majority. If we have problems, we have to call on God. We, as pensioners here, have no other option than to call for the help of the Supreme Being for solutions. “It is a pity a lot of our people have died. We have lost over 300 people. Many others are sick. Over 400 are bedridden because of the non-payment of their gratuities and pension arrears. Pensioners are elderly people. We need money for our welfare – feeding and drugs – to cater to our ailments as aged people. Our members have children that are unemployed and need to be catered for but we are made to suffer despite our meritorious service to the state and nation,” Agbaje said. The state governments always cite paucity of funds as the reason the pensioners are being owed, but Agbaje said it was a problem of misplaced priorities. A 66-year-old retired Ekiti teacher, Mr Olagoke Ogunbiyi, told Sunday PUNCH that since retiring in 2016 he had yet to receive his gratuity. An aged pensioner He said, “We are not happy with the outcome of things. All our efforts with the past government to ensure we get paid were futile. Many of our members are old, and others have died without getting the money they worked for. It has been an extremely tough time for pensioners in the state. We are being deprived of our means of livelihood.” The sexagenarian said it was bad enough that the pension was a mere pittance, yet it was not being released to them. “There are pensioners that receive N4,000 monthly as pension, despite the constitutional stipulation that pensions are supposed to be reviewed every five years or whenever the salary of workers is reviewed. Nothing is being done about pensions,” he said. Inside Nigeria’s pension law On its website, the National Pension Commission defines retirement benefits as “any entitlements/rights/privileges that accrue to a worker/employee upon leaving the services of an employer for the reason of having worked or provided service to the employer.” It added that “such benefits could be paid in either lump sum, periodically or a combination of both, and such arrangements could include multiple benefits and severance arrangements.” Further still, the body noted that the promulgation of the Pension Reform Act did not stop the payment of gratuity, or any form of severance benefits that existed before June 2004. Instead, it recognises the need for employers to honour their agreement with employees, giving place for collective bargaining for enhanced retirement entitlements. But in spite of the provisions, the hope of being paid pensions has become a mirage for millions of senior citizens in the country. No fewer than 22 out of the 36 states in the country have backlogs of unpaid pensions. Three months ago, while pensioners in Niger State staged a protest, one of them, Ibrahim Mahmud, said despite several bailouts and Paris Club funds the state received, pensioners were not paid. In September, angry pensioners in Ogun State protested the alleged non-payment of their N68bn gratuities arrears by the state government for 12 years. In April, retired civil servants in Abia State protested 38-month pension arrears and 20 years of gratuities. It is the same scenario in Rivers State. Questionable life pensions for govs, others Ironically, while it’s easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a retired civil servant to get their pensions paid, many states in the country have laws providing for humongous life pensions for governors and deputy governors who serve only four or eight years. Lagos State, which is Nigeria’s richest state, for example, has the Public Office Holder (Payment of Pension) Law No 11 official Gazette of Lagos State, 2007. The law stipulates that a governor, upon leaving office, is entitled (for life) to 100 per cent of the basic salary of the serving governor (N7.7m per annum), as well as free health care for himself and members of his family. The law also states that a former governor is entitled to six new cars every three years. He is also entitled to furniture allowance, which is 300 per cent of their annual basic salary (N23.3m); house maintenance allowance, which is 10 per cent of the basic salary (N778,296); utility allowance, which is 20 per cent of the salary (N1.5m) and car maintenance allowance, which is 30 per cent of the annual basic salary (N2.3m). You Might Also Like Other benefits include entertainment allowance, which is 10 per cent of the basic salary (N778,296), and a personal assistant, who will earn 25 per cent of the governor’s annual basic salary (N1.9m). The law adds that a former governor is entitled to domestic workers comprising a cook, a steward, a gardener, and others whose appointments are pensionable. A former governor will also be entitled to eight policemen and two officials of the Department of State Services for life, according to the Lagos law. In its pension law for ex-governors, Delta State provides a furnished duplex in Delta State or any other state in the country; medical treatment for them and members of their immediate families. A former governor is also entitled to two vehicles, including a utility vehicle, every two years. He is also to have two armed policemen and one DSS officer; 15 days annual vacation in any place of their choice and other benefits. The ex-deputy governors are also entitled to certain perks. Related News  Lagos pays N44.5bn to retirees in three years  Aggrieved workers transfer N483bn to new PFAs  Jumbo severance package: Buhari, Osinbajo, others to get N63bn, pensioners kick For Kano State, former governors and their deputies are entitled to 100 per cent of the incumbent’s basic salary, a six-bedroomed house, and free medical treatment for them and members of their families. Ekiti State makes provision for a life pension equivalent to the annual basic salary of the incumbent, a well-furnished five-bedroom duplex at any location within the state, two cars, one Pilot vehicle to be replaced every three years, 300 per cent furniture allowance amid other allowances for ex-governors of the state. Approximately 22 states including Oyo, Jigawa, Zamfara, Edo, Kwara, Yobe, Sokoto, Osun, and Rivers states offer parallel pension provisions for former governors and their deputies. Besides, at the federal level, former presidents are paid jumbo pensions. In the 2023 appropriation budget, about N13bn was proposed for the payment of pensions to former Presidents, Vice-Presidents, Heads of State, Chiefs of General Staff, retired heads of service, permanent secretaries, as well as retired heads of government agencies and parastatals. It is instructive that the life pensions of former political office holders do not fail. There has been no record of any of them complaining they never received it. Indeed, Rivers State paid N695m in entitlement to Sir Celestine Omehia, whose election as a governor was nullified by the Supreme Court. Yet, pensioners, who worked in civil service for 35 years, are not being paid their retirement entitlements. Pension for ex-govs, others, illegal – Court In 2019, the Federal High Court in Lagos pronounced as illegal and immoral payment of life pensions to ex-governors and their deputies who only serve for between four and eight years. The court, in a judgment by Justice Oluremi Oguntoyinbo, ordered the Attorney General of the Federation to take immediate legal action towards the abolishment of state laws permitting such pension arrangements. Justice Oguntoyinbo further ordered the AGF to take steps to “seek full recovery of funds from those involved.” The judge made the order in a judgment delivered in favour of an anti-corruption group, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project. In the public interest suit filed in 2017, SERAP had prayed the court to compel the AGF to go after and recover over N40bn collected as life pensions and emoluments by senators and ministers, who were once state governors. In 2020, SERAP filed a suit against the 36 states of the federation over life pensions being paid to former governors and their deputies. Though after Justice Oguntoyinbo’s judgment, the AGF, Abubakar Malami, had said he would go after states paying pensions to ex-governors and deputies, nothing has been heard of it. Shortly after the #EndSARS protests in which millions of youths took to the streets to demand good governance, the incumbent Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, announced his intention to scrap the pension law for ex-governors and their deputies in the state. But years after, the governor seems to have abandoned his promise. Unpaid gratuity, pension unfair -NUP The South-West Publicity Secretary of NUP, Segun Abatan, said Ogun, Ondo, Ekiti, and Osun states have poor records with the individual states owing about N28bn to N48bn as arrears of gratuity and pension. Abatan noted, “The situation with pensioners is very dire. Imo State is leading other states in the federation with unpaid pensions of about 72 months. It seems as though governors of states in Nigeria converged and decided to punish pensioners treating them like trash. With the upcoming elections, many governors have abandoned their duty posts and are busy converging for different political campaign meetings all over the country. This is the saddest aspect affecting not only the pensioners but also the citizenry.” Speaking on the clamour for a bill to be passed by the House of Representatives to punish erring governors, the publicity secretary said that the bill would amount to nothing since the law barely affects the rich and influential. He said, “In some states, governors are on life pension and are entitled to a house that will either be built in a big city such as Abuja, Lagos, or Port Harcourt. In Nigeria, there are two types of laws, one for the poor and another for the rich. In fact, the rich almost have no law guiding them. The law will just be on paper and won’t be implemented. “Imagine the kind of money an ex-governor or deputy who stole from the treasuries of their state receives as a life pension while a pensioner who earns N2,000 monthly are been owed for over five years. Apart from this, they are also paid other allowances running into billions of naira. With this enormous amount of money being paid to them, will one believe there is no money in Nigeria? There is huge mismanagement of funds in the country. Our president is the most paid in the world, the same applies to governors. We have to rise against this menace; that’s the only way to remedy it.” The chairman of NUP in Ekiti State, Mr Joel Akinola, called on the government to be committed to the prompt payment of pensions and gratuities. Akinola noted, “We have been agitating and appealing to the government to come to our rescue but they take us for granted and don’t pay attention to us or bother about our welfare because they believe pensioners cannot strike and don’t have electoral value. “Some pensioners are in abject poverty receiving N4,000 monthly that remains unpaid or partly paid. The children meant to take care of their parents are unemployed and depend on their parents for livelihood. That is the level of hopelessness an average pensioner in Ekiti is in now. It seems the government has given pensioners a death sentence that is why we have a good number of us dying daily.” The NUP chairman in Kogi State, Clement Ohida, also called for a review of the pension. He added, “We are constantly in dialogue with the government to harmonise both state and Local Government pensioners. By this I mean, those who retired as far back as 2000 receiving N10,000 should be reviewed because that money amounts to nothing currently and the law supports pension increments every five years or when there is an increase in the minimum wage for existing workers.” Similarly, the NUP General Secretary, Elder ActorZal, said, “It is our continuous plea to the government to pay up pensioners who have served their fatherland at this time when they can no longer work vigorously to survive. We keep urging the government to do what is right and pay regularly. Also, we have been hammering that the National Assembly should make non-payment of budgeted pension funds by state governments a criminal offence and sanction such erring governors, parastatals, or governments.” A social commentator, Mr Akin Fatunke, said it was unfortunate that nearly two decades after the contributory pension was established through the Pension Reform Act of 2004, most states have yet to sign onto it. Fatunke said states should develop the capacity to generate income internally and not depend solely on revenue from the Federal Government to survive. He said, “The non-remittance by NNPC to the federation account no doubt puts the states under a lot of pressure on finance-related issues. For instance, Abia State is owing 20 years of gratuities and 38 months of pension arrears while Ogun State owes about nine years of gratuities and pension deductions spanning over 21 months. Others owing a huge amount of gratuities include Benue, Taraba, Plateau, Anambra, Lagos, Kwara, Ekiti, and Adamawa. Indeed, the issue of pension and gratuity is a huge challenge for sitting governors as it predates their tenure in office and is seen as inherited responsibility.” However, he stated that some governors have not been too humble or appreciative of their poor financial state because they enjoy an extravagant lifestyle that has no affinity to the state of their states’ economy particularly in a democratic government. Fatunke urged the governors to demonstrate greater sensitivity to the plight of the pensioners and workers, adding that the economy with galloping inflation, coupled with unpaid arrears has made life miserable for the pensioners in terms of health, feeding or being able to live in a decent environment. He said, “It is disheartening and unacceptable that state governments are treating workers and the welfare of the pensioners in their respective states with levity. Not too long ago, some of these governors owing gratuities and pensions doled out N100m to purchase party presidential nomination forms. “The Federal Government and the organised labour unions should put pressure on the various governors to take matters concerning pensioners very seriously and pay up the accumulated gratuities and pension without further delay.” Similarly, another social commentator, Ayo-Bankole Akintujoye, stated that the only sustainable way to tackle the unpaid pension and gratuity issue was a forward-thinking regulation just like the recent ones being established by PENCOM. He added that there must be regulations that empowered Pension Fund Administrators to enforce the collection of pension funds on behalf of the employees through the law court to establish a standard. Akintujoye said, “The law should empower Pension Fund Administrators to effectively represent their clients and take the governments or companies who do not pay their staff to court on the issue. If they can effectively get a legal backing called a Locus Standi, then things will get better.”",4th December 2022,Blessing Afolabi,"""https://punchng.com/ex-govs-on-life-pension-live-in-luxury-retirees-languish-in-penury/""",2870,250,171,123,-0.03,Bad News

53, CONUA to sue FG over withheld salaries  ,"…says union not part of strike  The Congress of University Academics has expressed its disappointment with the Federal Government  especially the Ministry of Labour and Employment, over the non-payment of its members’ withheld salaries “even when the government knew that the union did not call for strike action and its members were not involved in the strike action that lasted for eight months and which shut down the university system nationwide.” CONUA, in a statement on Tuesday, signed by its National President, Secretary and Publicity Secretary, Dr Niyi Sunmonu, Dr Henry Oripeloye and Dr Ernest Nwoke, respectively, said it was wrong for the FG to lump CONUA with members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities who went on eight months strike between February and October, 2022. The new union of lecturers thereby viewed to sue FG for withholding its members’ salaries. The statement partly read, “CONUA formally made its non-involvement in the strike known to the Federal Government in a letter addressed to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, in April 2022. “In the letter, we made it clear that because CONUA constituted a separate and independent union in the university system, our members did not call for any strike. This was followed by a Press Conference in Abuja on August 19, 2022 at which it was categorically stated that CONUA was not part of any ongoing strike, and that the “No Work No Pay” principle ought not to apply to members of the union. “CONUA’s expectation is that, due to the express and categorical declaration, the government would seamlessly release our members’ outstanding salaries when it resumed the payment of salaries to all university staff in October 2022. But to our dismay, CONUA members were also paid pro-rata salaries in complete disregard to the fact that we were indeed shut out of duties by the strike. “Subsequently, we wrote to the Accountant-General of the Federatıon and the Ministry of Labour and Employment reminding them that it was an error to lump our members with those that declared and embarked on strike action. It was yet another shock for the outstanding backlog of salaries not to have been paid to our members along with the November 2022 salary.” Related News  FG adds media studies, others to varsities courses  FG, governors are entrenching poverty  3.24m buildings connected to power grid, says FG CONUA said the non-payment of “our withheld salaries” contravenes Section 43 (1b) of the Trade Disputes Act CAP.

Aregbesola stated this in his speech at the inauguration of service operational vehicles, junior staff quarters, Information and Communications Technology command and control rooms, unveiling of new uniform for staff of the NCoS and presentation of award to selected staff for gallantry, on Monday. He also said with this new development, inmates would be monitored without any violation of their rights. Aregbesola noted, “The NCoS is now, in line with what is obtainable internationally, becoming digitised. A Command and Control room is now established at the National Headquarters, while effective surveillance is mounted in the custodial centres to monitor the activities in some selected centres. This is a laudable landmark as it is the first of its kind in the history of the NCoS. “With eagle eyes on the custodial centres at all times, inmates can be monitored without any violation of their rights. With this development, jailbreaks and riots in our custodial centres can be prevented, checked and nipped in the bud before it escalates and external attacks can also be foiled since the service now has eyes everywhere.” Speaking on the inauguration, Aregbesola explained that the operational vehicles would help convey inmates to court and have their date with justice. He also added that the new uniform symbolised “the transition from a punitive prison system to a reformatory corrections system that is now the philosophy of the service.” The Minister explained, “The NCoS is required by law to convey awaiting trial inmates in custody to have their days in court. This is integral to the justice delivery system. Since the courts cannot possibly be there for a particular suspect’s case, inability to appear in court would lead to adjournment and prolonged trial.

It is my firm belief that these vehicles will serve the purpose. “In line with the Service’s commitment to improvement of staff welfare, we are also here today to inaugurate buildings meant for the accommodation of junior staff. This will enhance early resumption to duty and service delivery as expected since they will have the opportunity of living right inside the National Headquarters. “In recent times, some custodial centres were subjected to external attacks, leading to the escape of some inmates. In bringing them back to custody, some members of staff lost their lives while others sustained varying injuries in the process. To all those officers that had performed their duties as expected of them during these incidents, we salute your doggedness, sense of patriotism and gallantry. “Rewarding such gallant officers is in line with the NCoS Act, 2019 section 26 subsection 2a and b which states that the purpose of the Correctional Officers Reward Fund is for ‘rewarding correctional officers for extra or special service such as gallantry, long or meritorious service.’ “The change in the name from Nigerian Prisons Service to Nigerian Correctional Service requires a new face in the Service uniform that will reflect corrections not only as a name but in practice. We are also here therefore to unveil the new uniform for the NCoS.” In his welcome address, the Controller General of Corrections, Haliru Nababa, said the inaugurated projects were pivotal to the actualisation of the NCoS core mandates.

60,"  Controversy, protest trail teachers recruitment in Anambra&nbsp;  ","Some candidates who participated in the teachers’ recruitment exercise in Anambra State have protested their exclusion from the list of those finally selected. Two of the candidates who spoke to our correspondent in Awka  on Monday, on behalf of the aggrieved candidates, accused the state ministry of education and the Anambra State Universal Basic Education Board of failing to follow due process in the recruitment process and final selection. The state governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, had on Friday, presented appointment letters to 5,000 teachers recently recruited in the state. The presentation took place at the International Conference Centre, Awka. Soludo said the exercise was a fulfilment of his campaign promises.  But while speaking to our correspondent on the matter, one of the candidates, who identified herself as Chioma Evelyn, from Njikoka Local Government Area of the state, said having scored 71.5 per cent as total aggregate, she was not selected while those who scored far below were chosen, wondering the criteria that were adopted in the final selection. The 31-year-old Evelyn lamented that her name which was initially on the original list was omitted from the final list without any tangible explanation, adding that some candidates who are close to some people in the corridors of power were chosen based on favouritism.  She said, “I did the documentation under ASUBEB and my name was the second on the original list with them, but when the list was finally submitted, they omitted my name. My aggregate score is 71.5 per cent, but to my surprise, people who scored 50 per cent were selected. “Majority of us who scored above 70 per cent have this same issue. Some of us scored 90 per cent, without being chosen, while people who scored 50 per cent were taken. Nobody is telling us why it is so and why our names were removed at the last minute.  “They never told us they will use any special criteria in the selection process, some of us were at the ICC during the inauguration of the teachers, and we approached the commissioner for education, but she only told us that the matter will be looked into. “I do not deserve to be omitted as people who scored far below were selected. I was documented, and my name appeared on the original list from the ministry of education, but what happened at the last minute, is something no one has explained.” Another candidate, who gave her name as Ijeoma Okeke, from Idemili North Local Government Area, accused the ASUBEB and the ministry of education of selecting people at random without following the cut-off criteria. Related News  Osun town kingmakers, princes disagree on protest  Senegal: Hundreds march to demand release of journalist  Controversy surrounds killing of 12 persons in Taraba Okeke said, “I scored 72 per cent in the interview and my overall aggregate score is 70.5 per cent, but I was not selected, I applied for Biology. My surprise is that those who scored far below made up the list. “My name was initially on the list, I did my documentation on November 15, but when they brought out the final list, I did not find my name there. I went to the office of ASUBEB, and the chairman told me that it was an omission, but a staff in that office, told me that those who did not have B.Ed or NCE were removed. “Initially, they did not tell us it must be B.Ed or NCE. They told us to apply and that on-the-job training will be given to successful applicants, but now, they have turned everything upside down. Our names were intentionally removed because they were selecting people at random after the interview without following the cut-off criteria. “I have gone to ASUBEB and I was told to report to my local government in Idemili North.” When contacted, the state Commissioner for Education, Prof. Ngozi Chuma-Udeh, insisted that due process was followed in the recruitment process, regretting that the protesters did not appreciate the governor’s magnanimity in recruiting 5,000 teachers at a stretch in this difficult time. “We have more than 40,000 persons, who applied for this job. After the recruitment exercises, we have as many as 8,000 candidates qualified and suitable in different subject areas. Meanwhile, we have limited spaces of 5,000 slots to fill. “What we did was that In the recruitment process, we allotted 40 per cent to merit, 20 per cent to LGAs of origin, and 10 per cent to educationally disadvantaged areas like Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Ogbaru and others. We also allotted 20 per cent to core subject areas, and 10 per cent to technical subjects. “71 per cent or 72 per cent aggregates are good scores, but if the person is not favoured by any of the criteria above, he cannot get the job.  “For instance, if 200 slots are allocations for a local government based on merit, and if 210 persons got 80 per cent and above in a particular LGA, certainly, a candidate scoring 72 per cent cannot get the job. We cannot allow what belongs to another LGA to you from a different LGA because you score higher grades. “We cannot recruit somebody whose subject area is not relevant to our schools’ curriculum because he has a high aggregate in the exam. “Again, somebody from educationally disadvantaged areas like Ayamelum could be recruited with 50 per cent aggregate; but somebody from Awka South who has 72 per cent aggregates may not secure the job; based on certain considerations. We must understand these dynamics,” Chuma-Udeh added.",6th December 2022,Ikenna Obianeri,"""https://punchng.com/controversy-protest-trail-teachers-recruitment-in-anambra/""",929,125,60,43,-0.07,Bad News

The PUNCH had earlier reported that the former Lagos governor was in Chatham House on Monday to speak to Nigerians in the Diaspora on why he should be elected in 2023. As he was asked by the moderator to respond to some questions asked, Tinubu said he would assign some members of his entourage to do so.

The NANS JCC (Ondo) said students were being painfully marginalised, bitterly ignored and sidelined from governance and the dividends of good governance which has in turn invited untold hardship upon the students and severed the relationship between the students and the state government.

Nigerian students in Ondo State have been painfully marginalised, bitterly ignored and sidelined from governance and the dividends of good governance which has in turn invited untold hardship upon the students. “The level of neglect the entire students community has received from the Akeredolu-led government is sardonic, shambolic and painful because we believe that Nigerian students deserve no such punishment from the present-day government of Ondo State. “The current administration of Gov. Rotimi Odunayo Akeredolu has created a huge gap between the students and the government due to total neglect of the students’ constituency.  “The inability of Ondo State Government to provide infrastructural development in the State tertiary institutions has totally severed the relationship between the students and the Governor, H.E Akeredolu Odunayo Rotimi. The students fear the Governor might have little passion for the future of the State and the country at large. “Over the years, the education budget of the state is at an all-time low as a result of lack of funding for the education sector. The level of insecurity of lives and properties of the students around the campus and its environs has been disheartening and at a high level.

68,"  Tinubu takes campaign to UK, Atiku train storms Lagos  ","•Atiku appeals to Lagos voters •Tinubu accuses opponents of playing dirty politics The presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress in the 2023 general elections  Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Monday took his campaign to London, United Kingdom, where he revealed his plans to rebuild the nation’s economy, security and foreign policy if elected as president. This came as the presidential candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, stormed Lagos and urged Lagosians to change the APC government which he said had been dominated by one family. Tinubu, who spoke at the Chatham House in London, shared his thoughts during an addressed titled “Nigeria’s 2023 elections: Security, economic and foreign policy imperatives.” He said, “The challenges which have manifested themselves with regard to our national and regional development, as well as security trajectories, are very well-known to all of us here – radical extremist violence, terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, human trafficking, trafficking in weapons, trafficking in drugs, climate change and resource-driven conflicts.” Tinubu was accompanied to the lecture by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Governors Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Abubakar Bello (Niger), Ben Ayade (Cross Rivers),  Abubakar Badaru, (Jigawa), David Umahi (Ebonyi) as well as the former governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and ex-National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole. Others were former deputy governor of Lagos State, Chief Femi Pedro; former Lagos State Commissioner for Information, Dele Alake; PCC Finance Director, Olawale Edun; Senator Tokunbo Abiru, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi, former deputy governor of Ogun State, Chief Segun Adesegun, Hadiza Bala-Usman and a Lagos APC chieftain, Alhaji Mutiu Are. The APC candidate also reiterated his desire to consolidate the gains of the current administration, especially in the area of agriculture and infrastructure. Tinubu also expressed willingness to engage the private sector actively if he wins the February 25, 2023 presidential poll. He stated, “I guess my name is Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the current president is Muhammadu Buhari. There is nowhere in the constitution that says the current administration can’t be in continuity. This doesn’t mean removal from adaptation to my own developmental policies. I did it in Lagos. “The present administration has invested heavily in agriculture, providing loans and expanding the country’s total acreage of cultivated land. We will build on this, but our focus will be on using technology and expertise to accelerate growth and development by providing the critical infrastructure necessary to achieve the commodity transformations in the agriculture value chain.” He added, “Roads, rail, access to ports, and storage infrastructure are what we require to radically transform the agriculture sector and increase its value to the nation. Providing these will be the areas of our focus so that the full potential of our agro-economy can be achieved, and we can reap the benefits in jobs, improved economic opportunities and increased prosperity.” The former Lagos State governor also unveiled plans to fix the energy sector crisis. He said, “Fixing the perennial riddle of energy supply is another priority.  There is no version of the world where Nigeria’s ambitions for itself can be achieved without solving the problem of how to provide energy to homes and businesses across the country.  It is time to recognise that the centralised approach to energy policy and infrastructure is not an optimal arrangement and is unlikely to improve by mere tinkering around the sides. “The Federal Government as regulator and operator, and price fixer is a broken model and one that we fully intend to fix if elected.” El-Rufai speaks In a related development, Kaduna State governor, El-Rufai, spoke on how Tinubu presidency could tackle the perennial challenge of insecurity and shortage of manpower in the country. El-Rufai, who was delegated by Tinubu to react to a question raised on Nigeria’s security issue, expressed concerns that the problem goes beyond economic activities. He said, “Security has been a big issue in Nigeria in the last few years and that has affected not only real economics but agricultural production, commerce and everything else. The Bola Tinubu administration will address these challenges in at least three ways. “First, policing, Nigeria has about 300, 000 policemen for a population of over 200 million. We need at least twice that number. That will be achieved by amending the constitution so that policing can be at the federal, state and community level. “With an increased security footprint, there will be fewer criminal activities. The second step is to look at our armed forces and security architecture. Nigeria’s armed forces are not more than 200,000 in size including the Army, Navy and Air force while some countries are looking at a space military, we are struggling with just 200,000 members of the armed forces. “The numbers, equipment, skills and training of the armed forces will be scaled up, it will be increased rapidly to meet the asymmetric nature of the security challenges that we face. This is because today, the armed forces are not fighting with other countries. They are fighting with non-state actors and the doctrine, training and numbers must change. “In 1967, the total size of the Nigerian army was only 10,000 because of the civil war. Within a year, we ramped it up to 250,000 so it can be done and what we are facing in Nigeria today-banditry, terrorism and oil theft-requires a new approach. We will ensure that our country is not only internally safe but also not a threat to our neighbours. “Thirdly, the issue of proliferation of small arms following the collapse of Libya, which is by no means fault of ours, will have to be addressed through collaboration with countries like Mali, Niger, Sudan and Chad. This has already started but will be deepened under the leadership of a new security team under the Bola Tinubu administration.” Atiku arrives Lagos Meanwhile, the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku, urged Lagos residents to liberate themselves from the rule of a family government and replace it with the people’s government by voting for the party in the forthcoming elections.

Atiku, who was present with his wife, Mrs Titi Abubakar, promised to restructure the country and empower youths with Small and Medium Enterprises if elected president. He said, “I want to give you a short history. This history is about 53 years ago, in 1969 when I first came to Lagos; there was only one Carter Bridge built by the Europeans. There was no Second Mainland Bridge, no Third Mainland Bridge, or the Tafawa Balewa Square. “It was the Federal Government that built the Second and Third Mainland Bridges and rebuilt the Carter Bride, Agege Motor Road, Ikorodu, and all the major roads connecting the island with the mainland. Now the APC government is claiming that they developed Lagos; they did not develop Lagos at all. They are lying to you. “Therefore, it is time for you the people of Lagos to liberate yourself from a family government to the people’s government, and that people’s government is going to be led by Jandor. “People of Lagos, it is high time you took your destiny into your own hands for your future, not for the future of one family. In the last 23 years, you have been governed by one family and it is your right and your duty to take over that governance and hand it over to yourselves that is what the PDP stands for. “On my own part, if you elect me as president, I promise by the grace of God, I am going to set aside $10bn so that we can empower our young men and women in SMEs. People were asking me where I was going to get that money. If I privatise Port Harcourt, Warri, and Kaduna refineries, I am going to get that money. “Let me also promise you, if you vote for the PDP government we will restructure this country. What do we mean by that? We will give your states and local governments more power and resources, so it is up to you to hold them responsible.” In his speech, the party’s vice presidential candidate, Ifeanyi Okowa, said, “Atiku is the only presidential candidate who is accepted in all the geopolitical zones of Nigeria. And the reason he is accepted is that he is a man that means well for this country. He is the only presidential candidate that has the experience to take us out of the troubles that we are in. “We want a Nigeria that works for everybody and we want a Lagos State that works for everybody. The Nigeria of today is not the Nigeria of our dreams and I urge all of you to vote for Atiku because he will restore the country’s lost glory.” Ayu confident On his part, the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, noted that the PDP would liberate and rescue Lagos State. He said, “We shall rescue Lagos from the hands of people who don’t want progress for Lagos people and Nigerians. Liberating Lagos is like liberating Nigeria because Lagos is an important part of Nigeria. “Lagos is the biggest city in the country with a population of about 25 million people which is more than most African countries and other countries in the world. It is a very rich state, a state where there should be no poverty. “In 1993, our leader Chief MKO Abiola said farewell to poverty was going to begin in Lagos. We have brought to you hope, we have brought you a man who is experienced, who knows Lagos, who knows Nigerians, who is leading the crusade to rescue Lagos, end poverty, and create jobs. With a president from the PDP, we shall make sure that it will be better for all of us.” Dogara welcomed During the rally, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, was received into the party, after his defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress. “I want to assure the people of Lagos, that for us it is the unity, peace, and progress of this country that bother us and we have looked at all the tickets and we believe it is Atiku and Okowa who will deliver on the great promise of this nation,” he stated in his brief address. Also speaking at the event, the Chairman of the Presidential Campaign Council of the PDP and Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Emmanuel Udom, said, “In those days, the economy of Lagos State was more buoyant than those of West African countries all together. Today, if you enter Oregun, Ilupeju and Oba Akran, do you still have all those companies again? No. In the days of PDP, the economy was moving. “Lagos is where money is made, Abuja is where money is saved and the South-South is where money is produced. Under PDP, we will restore the economy of Nigeria. All those factories that have left Lagos today will all come back. In the Atiku Abubakar’s administration, the economy of Lagos will bounce back.” The Lagos State PDP governorship candidate, Olajide Adediran (popularly known as Jandor), who was present with his running mate, Funke Akindele, faulted the Lagos State government over the increased rate of unemployment since 2019. He said, “We need to recover Nigeria to rescue Lagos, and February 25th is the date we are going to do this. I won’t speak about their 23 years of hardship because that is there for everybody to see. But in 2019, when the current government took over power, poverty rate in Lagos State was 4.5 per cent; today it is 8.5 per cent. At that time unemployment rate was 14.6 per cent, today it is 37.6 per cent.  “Funke and I, for 20 years now have been contributing our own quota, employing people, paying salaries and today we can beat our chests and stand in front of everybody to say it is by our effort and the grace of God.” PDP govs speak Also present at the rally were the Governor of Taraba State, Darius Ishaku; the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki; the Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri; the National Chairman of PDP; former Senate Presidents Dr Bukola Saraki and Anyim Pius Anyim; the Lagos State PDP Chairman, Philip Aivoji, and the state Chairman of the PDP Presidential Campaign Committee, Mr Adedeji Doherty, among others.

72,  Oil theft: Navy denies blaming NNPCL  ,"The Nigerian Navy on Monday said it did not indict the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation Limited over oil theft in the country. The Director of Information  Nigeria Navy, Adedotun Ayo-Vaughan, made this known in a press release on Monday. Ayo-Vaughan was reacting to a media report that the Navy accused the NNPCL of allegedly not revealing the true cause(s) of crude oil theft in the country, but reeling out exaggerated figures to save its face. The report was said to have emanated from an interactive hearing before the Senate Committee on Economic and Financial Crimes during which the relevant agencies implementing the Proceeds of Crime (Recovery and Management) Act, 2022, briefed the committee at the National Assembly. Ayo-Vaughan said, “The report indicated that the chairman of the committee demanded explanations on why the country continued to experience cases of oil theft if the waterways were secured. “The distinguished senator had queried that, ‘The oil theft issue has been a very worrisome one to every Nigerian and more importantly, it has negatively impacted our economy. How come the Navy hasn’t been able to solve the issue of oil theft and if the Navy is claiming that the waterways are secured, why are there still cases of oil theft?’ Related News  NNPCL signs MoU with Ghanaian, Gambian firms  NNPC not sincere about oil theft, exaggerating figures –Navy  SERAP, Rivers community, others sue FG for oil theft “Equally, it was mentioned that another senator noted that at an oversight function, the NNPCL said crude pipelines were being tapped from the pressure pipe under the sea and crude oil was usually transferred from there into vessels, and this had been happening for nine years. “He reportedly asked, ‘Is the Navy aware or not of the tapping going on under the sea?’ The questions were all responded to and in the course of responding, it was explained that the challenge is due to the criminal activity inshore by the illegal local refiners in tapping into the export lines many of which have not been in operation since early this year, 2022, resulting in opportunity lost.” Ayo-Vaughan said major terminals had not been able to process crude for export since around February/March, adding that this inability to process as export was reported as stolen oil since it was practically impossible to steal and move 100,000 barrels per day out of the creeks. He added, “The Navy representative at the Senate hearing repeatedly mentioned that the Navy is not indicting the NNPCL in any way and has been working with the national oil giant to curb the menace of crude oil theft since April 1, 2022, when Operation Dakatar Da Barawo  was launched in Onne, Rivers State as a mutual effort and synergy between the Navy and NNPCL to address issues of crude oil theft, rampant illegal artisan refineries and illegal oil bunkering amongst other criminalities in the creeks. “At the strategic level, almost daily and regular consultations, engagements and meetings are held between the Navy and NNPCL to review the situation, appraise the approach to curb the menace and proffer ways forward. “Pertinently, to attempt to imply otherwise will be a gross misrepresentation of the cordial and mutual working relationship between the two organisations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Nigerian Navy under the able leadership of Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo has been and will continue to work with the NNPCL to fashion out solutions and remedies to the challenges in Nigeria’s maritime environment concerning the oil industry for the overall good of Nigeria and indeed for all well-meaning Nigerians.”",6th December 2022,Deji Lambo,"""https://punchng.com/oil-theft-navy-denies-blaming-nnpcl/""",594,100,66,15,-0.06,Bad News

82, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky named Time's Person-of-the-Year  ,"President of Ukraine  Volodymyr Zelensky, has been named Time’s 2022 Person of the Year. Time Magazine made the announcement on Wednesday, hailing the wartime president for his unwavering strength and “contagious” courage in the face of “unprovoked Russian aggression.” Zelensky, who has led his country in the ongoing war with Russia, refused to leave the country at the onset of the war despite offers from other country leaders. Instead, Zelensky has been constantly seeking support from world leaders during the war, which has lasted for over ten months. “TIME’s 2022 Person of the Year: Volodymyr Zelensky and the spirit of Ukraine,” the magazine cover read. Time’s reporter, Simon Shuster, wrote: “Zelensky’s success as a wartime leader has relied on the fact that courage is contagious. “It spread through Ukraine’s political leadership in the first days of the invasion, as everyone realised the president had stuck around. “His professional instincts derived from a lifetime as an actor on the stage meant he knew how to read a crowd and react to its moods and expectations. Now his audience was the world. He was determined not to let them down. Related News  Zelensky speaks on 100 days war with Russia, vows victory  Danish PM says volunteers can join Ukraine fight “Courage came to define his fellow Ukrainians, too. Instead of running for their lives, many Ukrainians grabbed whatever weapons they could find and ran to defend their towns and cities against an invading force armed with tanks and attack helicopters.” Zelensky, who had surprisingly emerged as Ukraine’s president in 2019, was formerly a comedian and TV personality. In Wednesday’s publication, Shuster noted that the once light-hearted man had changed a great deal following the invasion of Russia into his homeland. “In April, less than two months into the invasion, Zelensky told me he had aged and changed ‘from all this wisdom that I never wanted,’” he wrote. Speaking on Ukraine’s recent recapture of a major city, Kherson, from Russian occupation, the president said that in making battlefield decisions, he would focus first on human lives “We could have pushed into Kherson earlier, with greater force, but we understood how many people would have fallen,” he said in the interview. “That’s why a different tactic was chosen, and thank God it worked. I don’t think it was some genius move on our part. It was reason winning out, wisdom winning out against speed and ambition.” Russia continues to face international sanctions as a result of its president, Vladimir Putin’s refusal to back down from his plans to annex the neighbouring country’s territories.

D’banj was reportedly detained by the ICPC on Tuesday, December 6, 2022, after being questioned by officials of the commission.

The procedure entails that registered voters with access to the Internet could go to a dedicated portal to ascertain whether their PVCs are ready and to find their locations for subsequent collection. “All they are required to do is to provide their details such as name, date of birth, state of registration or the last six digits of the VINs that they provided/received during registration, to locate their cards. This would improve the PVC collection process, but without prejudice to those who wish to go directly to the collection centres. “For the newer PVCs, that is, those from the Continuous Voter Registration that took place between January and July 2022, the VINs were harvested automatically and made available online. However, for the older uncollected PVCs that predate the new guidelines, their VINs must be harvested manually and painstakingly for upload to the PVC collection portal. The portal will also improve the records of the Commission regarding collected and uncollected PVCs. “While the Commission appreciates the vigilance of Nigerians and their determination to see the conduct of free, fair, credible and inclusive elections in 2023, it is exceedingly important that information such as contained in the said video is verified before sharing it with the public.”",7th December 2022,Gift Habib,"""https://punchng.com/inec-debunks-viral-video-on-voter-identification-number/""",423,74,52,15,-0.05,Bad News

A rights advocate and APC stalwart  Ngozika Ihuoma, had dragged Tinubu and the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar, to court on June 9 for allegedly violating extant electoral laws few days after the former Lagos State Governor won the APC presidential primary. In the suit marked FHC/ ABJ/CS/854/2022, the two presidential candidates were sued alongside their parties, Independent National Electoral Commission and the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation. Ihuoma sought for six reliefs, which included INEC barring Tinubu from contesting the 2023 presidential election. In defense of the suit, the law office of Babatunde Ogala (SAN) & Co on behalf of the APC filed a counter affidavit in opposition to the originating summons and a notice of preliminary objection. The case was however dismissed by the Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday. Justice Fadima Muritala described the plaintiff as a “meddlesome interloper having no locus standi to institute the suit.” Related News  APC sets up committee to debunk lies against Tinubu  Tinubu will defeat Kwankwaso in Kano - Commissioner   PICTORIAL: Supporters gather at APC presidential rally in Bayelsa  He, therefore, dismissed the case for being speculative after APC’s counsel, Julius Ishola Esq, from Babatunde Ogala had urged the court to dismiss it with heavy cost for wasting judicial time.

The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, made this known on the floor of the Senate while ruling on a point of order raised by the Chairman, Senate Public Accounts Committee, Senator Matthew Urhoghide. Urhoghide, who came under a point of order, drew the attention of his colleagues to the flagrant disregard of heads of federal MDAs to Senate invitations to answer queries raised against them by the Auditor-General of the Federation. He lamented that the agencies’ heads, who were public officers, were disrespecting the Senate despite the fact that Sections 88 and 89 of the Constitution gave the red chamber power to summon them. Some of the MDAs are: Office of the Accountant General of the Federation; Ministries of Interior; Transportation; Mines and Solid Mineral Development; Information; Communication; Petroleum; Defence; Police Affairs; Sports; Works and Housing; and Women Affairs. Others are: the State House; Presidential Fleet; Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps; Independent National Electoral Commission; North-East Development Commission; Nigerian Intelligence Agency; and the Nigerian Air Force, among others.

102,  China loosens strict COVID restrictions  ,"China announced Wednesday a nationwide loosening of Covid restrictions following protests against the hardline strategy that grew into calls for greater political freedoms. Anger over China’s zero-Covid policy  which involved mass lockdowns, constant testing and quarantines even for people who are not infected, stoked unrest not seen since the 1989 pro-democracy protests. Under the new guidelines announced by the National Health Commission, the frequency and scope of PCR testing — long a tedious mainstay of life in zero-Covid China — will be reduced. Lockdowns will also be scaled down and people with non-severe Covid cases can isolate at home instead of centralised government facilities. And people will no longer be required to show a green health code on their phone to enter public buildings and spaces, except for “nursing homes, medical institutions, kindergartens, middle and high schools.” The new rules scrap the forced quarantines for people with no symptoms or with mild cases. “Asymptomatic infected persons and mild cases who are eligible for home isolation are generally isolated at home, or they can voluntarily choose centralised isolation for treatment,” the new rules read. “Mass PCR testing only carried out in schools, hospitals, nursing homes and high-risk work units; scope and frequency of PCR testing to be further reduced,” they added. “People travelling across provinces do not need to provide a 48h test result and do not need to test upon arrival.” China will also accelerate the vaccination of the elderly, the NHC said, long seen as a major obstacle to the relaxation of Beijing’s no-tolerance approach to Covid. Rare demonstrations against the ruling Communist Party’s zero-Covid strategy broke out across China late last month. They expanded into calls for more political freedoms, with some even calling for President Xi Jinping to resign. Related News  China eases COVID-19 measures after protests  Covid protest: China censors feed from World Cup  UK condemns China for BBC journalist's arrest Authorities cracked down on subsequent efforts to protest while easing a number of restrictions, with some Chinese cities tentatively rolling back mass testing and curbs on movement. The capital Beijing, where many businesses have fully reopened, said this week that commuters were no longer required to show a negative virus test taken within 48 hours to use public transport. Financial hub Shanghai, which underwent a brutal two-month lockdown this year, announced the same rules, with residents able to enter outdoor venues such as parks and tourist attractions without a recent test. And once dominated by doom and gloom coverage of the dangers of the virus and scenes of pandemic chaos abroad, China’s tightly controlled media dramatically shifted tone to support a tentative moving away from zero-Covid. The prevalent Omicron strain is “not at all like last year’s Delta variant,” Guangzhou-based medicine professor Chong Yutian said in an article published by the Communist Party-run China Youth Daily. “After infection with the Omicron variant, the vast majority will have no or light symptoms, and very few will go on to have severe symptoms, this is already widely known,” he assured readers. But analysts at Japanese firm Nomura on Monday calculated that 53 cities — home to nearly a third of China’s population — still had some restrictions in place. Wednesday’s announcement came hours after the government released further data showing the crippling economic impacts of zero-Covid. Imports and exports plunged in November to levels not seen since early 2020. Imports in November fell 10.6 percent year-on-year, the biggest drop since May 2020, according to the General Administration of Customs. Exports fell 8.7 percent over the same period.

107,  Benchers warn against proliferation of Law School campuses  ,"The Body of Benchers on Tuesday warned the National Assembly against giving effect to its proposal to regulate the establishment of Law Schools in the country. The Chairman of BOB  Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), issued the warning while admitting 4,691 new lawyers at the Call to Bar ceremony.  He said, “May we plead with the National Assembly to stop toying with the idea of promulgating laws or amending the Legal Practitioners Act, to pave way for the proliferation of Law School campuses, particularly, around the neighbourhoods of some lawmakers.  “It is within the exclusive prerogative of the Council of Legal Education, in consultation with the Body of Benchers to establish new Law School campuses.  “While I do not question the jurisdiction of the National Assembly to make laws as appropriate, Law School campuses cannot be established without clearance from the Council of Legal Education.  “What we need now is the improvement and upgrading of the existing Law School campuses, using the newly commissioned Graham Douglas Law School Campus, Port Harcourt, built and equipped by the Rivers State Government as a model.

NBA, in a statement by its National President, Mr Yakubu Maikyau (SAN), said the action was based on Olanipekun’s refusal to step aside. Maikyau stated that the lawyers’ umbrella body, had in a letter copied to the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, asked Olanipekun to step aside as leader of the BoB pending investigations into allegations of misconduct against him by Adekunbi Ogunde, who claimed he (Olanipekun) influenced judges to favour clients who patronise his firm.  The NBA had consequently told Olanipekun to allow his deputy, Justice Mary Odili (retd.), to preside over the Call to Bar, a request he ignored. At the ceremony, Olanipekun advised the new lawyers to always uphold the ethics of the profession and desist from acts that could portray the profession in a bad light. Earlier, the Director General of the Nigerian Law School, Prof. Isa Chiroma (SAN), said the new lawyers completed the vocational training at the Nigerian Law School as prescribed by the Legal Education Act of 1962.  According to him, out of a total of 5,802 students who participated in the exams, 4691 emerged successful representing 80.81 per cent.  A breakdown of the results showed that 119 students came out with 1st Class; 789 with 2nd Class Upper; 2, 460, 2nd Class Lower; and 1, 323 came out with Pass; while students were from the last exam.",7th December 2022,Friday Olokor and Esther Blankson,"""https://punchng.com/benchers-warn-against-proliferation-of-law-school-campuses/""",465,74,53,18,-0.05,Bad News

111,  No proof I share from Lagos revenue – Tinubu  ,"The presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress  Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has said there is no proof that he gets a share of the revenue generated by Lagos State which he once governed. Speaking in an interview with BBC Africa, monitored by our correspondent on Tuesday, Tinubu stated that since he left office in 2007, he was yet to get any government appointment or contract. He said those behind the allegation are only envious of him just as he revealed that he got his wealth through investments in real estate which he inherited and turned their values around. On his campaign, he said, “Things are going very well. I’m very confident that this election will be free and fair. I’m the front runner and that is why I’m getting many arrows.” Talking about his priorities if sworn in as President, he said, “Security and economic recovery to accelerated development, to get Nigerians employed and get inflation down. You know, monetary policy needs to be changed. Subsidy needs to be decided upon and then removed.” On what he will do about the insecurity in the country, Tinubu said it had reduced, just as he commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for that. He said, “It’s reduced. I will defend him for that. Then, 17 local governments and about four states where we have flags of foreign jihadists in Nigeria. That is no more. That is long gone. “To start chaos is easy. To bring normalcy and redecorate is more difficult. “Here we are, Buhari has degraded, but not completely eliminated ISWAP. They will talk briefly about lethal weapons, ammunition and technological equipment that could have helped accelerate the cleanup of those. “The West is yet to feel comfortable enough with a Buhari administration to sell us the arms and technology necessary.” Asked if things would be different with the West under his administration, Tinubu said, “It could change, it might not change. But we have to look at, you know, alternatives. And those are the mass recruitment of individuals in a volunteer army to really clean up.” Related News  Speak on LG autonomy, NULGE tells Tinubu, Atiku  Tinubu’s candidacy built on grand scam - Atiku PCC  No proof I get share of Lagos revenue - Tinubu Asked why Nigerians should vote for him despite how they feel about the Buhari regime, he said, “Because I’m different.

I have continuity in Lagos. “Buhari has done his best. I can’t run away from him being my friend, my leader in the party. I will not.” The former governor was then asked if Nigerians had the right to know where their next president got his wealth. “Are they enemies of wealth? If they are not enemies of wealth, investments do yield. “I have an example of Warren Buffet, one of the richest in America and the world. He started with stock buying and brokerages. “I inherited great real estate. I turned the values around. I’m not denying my wealth. I have not been… I was the most investigated, the most accused governor in opposition up to, you know, for eight years and up to 2007. “And since I left the office, I’m still there, I’ve not taken any government appointment, no government contract.” On allegations that he was getting a share of the revenues Lagos was getting, he said, “Hey, excuse me, share, what? Have they proven it? The World Bank and IMF have investigated the records in Lagos State. What’s wrong with them? It’s envy, envy, envy.” In response to choosing between the other candidates if he was not contesting in the presidential race, he said, “None, because they are not as competent as any other person out there.

Time Magazine made the announcement on Wednesday, hailing the wartime president for his unwavering strength and “contagious” courage in the face of “unprovoked Russian aggression.” Zelensky, who has led his country in the ongoing war with Russia, refused to leave the country at the onset of the war despite offers from other country leaders. Instead, Zelensky has been constantly seeking support from world leaders during the war, which has lasted for over ten months. “TIME’s 2022 Person of the Year: Volodymyr Zelensky and the spirit of Ukraine,” the magazine cover read. Time’s reporter, Simon Shuster, wrote: “Zelensky’s success as a wartime leader has relied on the fact that courage is contagious. “It spread through Ukraine’s political leadership in the first days of the invasion, as everyone realised the president had stuck around. “His professional instincts derived from a lifetime as an actor on the stage meant he knew how to read a crowd and react to its moods and expectations. Now his audience was the world. He was determined not to let them down. Related News  Zelensky speaks on 100 days war with Russia, vows victory  Danish PM says volunteers can join Ukraine fight “Courage came to define his fellow Ukrainians, too. Instead of running for their lives, many Ukrainians grabbed whatever weapons they could find and ran to defend their towns and cities against an invading force armed with tanks and attack helicopters.” Zelensky, who had surprisingly emerged as Ukraine’s president in 2019, was formerly a comedian and TV personality. In Wednesday’s publication, Shuster noted that the once light-hearted man had changed a great deal following the invasion of Russia into his homeland. “In April, less than two months into the invasion, Zelensky told me he had aged and changed ‘from all this wisdom that I never wanted,’” he wrote. Speaking on Ukraine’s recent recapture of a major city, Kherson, from Russian occupation, the president said that in making battlefield decisions, he would focus first on human lives “We could have pushed into Kherson earlier, with greater force, but we understood how many people would have fallen,” he said in the interview. “That’s why a different tactic was chosen, and thank God it worked. I don’t think it was some genius move on our part. It was reason winning out, wisdom winning out against speed and ambition.” Russia continues to face international sanctions as a result of its president, Vladimir Putin’s refusal to back down from his plans to annex the neighbouring country’s territories.

The procedure entails that registered voters with access to the Internet could go to a dedicated portal to ascertain whether their PVCs are ready and to find their locations for subsequent collection. “All they are required to do is to provide their details such as name, date of birth, state of registration or the last six digits of the VINs that they provided/received during registration, to locate their cards. This would improve the PVC collection process, but without prejudice to those who wish to go directly to the collection centres. “For the newer PVCs, that is, those from the Continuous Voter Registration that took place between January and July 2022, the VINs were harvested automatically and made available online. However, for the older uncollected PVCs that predate the new guidelines, their VINs must be harvested manually and painstakingly for upload to the PVC collection portal. The portal will also improve the records of the Commission regarding collected and uncollected PVCs. “While the Commission appreciates the vigilance of Nigerians and their determination to see the conduct of free, fair, credible and inclusive elections in 2023, it is exceedingly important that information such as contained in the said video is verified before sharing it with the public.”",7th December 2022,Gift Habib,"""https://punchng.com/inec-debunks-viral-video-on-voter-identification-number/""",423,74,52,15,-0.05,Bad News

He also alleged that the SPDC short-paid his client for three years by converting his payments from Dollars to Naira and that all entreaties made to the Company to be paid fell on deaf ears. He requested that the Senate should look into the matter and direct SPDC to among other things, pay his client N335,070,000 and $5,942,000 being the cost of the contract from 2009 to date. The lawyers of the petitioner and SPDC were invited to appear before the Committee on October 18,  2022. The lawyer appeared but did not make a presentation because SPDC did not show up.

134,  China loosens strict COVID restrictions  ,"China announced Wednesday a nationwide loosening of Covid restrictions following protests against the hardline strategy that grew into calls for greater political freedoms. Anger over China’s zero-Covid policy  which involved mass lockdowns, constant testing and quarantines even for people who are not infected, stoked unrest not seen since the 1989 pro-democracy protests. Under the new guidelines announced by the National Health Commission, the frequency and scope of PCR testing — long a tedious mainstay of life in zero-Covid China — will be reduced. Lockdowns will also be scaled down and people with non-severe Covid cases can isolate at home instead of centralised government facilities. And people will no longer be required to show a green health code on their phone to enter public buildings and spaces, except for “nursing homes, medical institutions, kindergartens, middle and high schools.” The new rules scrap the forced quarantines for people with no symptoms or with mild cases. “Asymptomatic infected persons and mild cases who are eligible for home isolation are generally isolated at home, or they can voluntarily choose centralised isolation for treatment,” the new rules read. “Mass PCR testing only carried out in schools, hospitals, nursing homes and high-risk work units; scope and frequency of PCR testing to be further reduced,” they added. “People travelling across provinces do not need to provide a 48h test result and do not need to test upon arrival.” China will also accelerate the vaccination of the elderly, the NHC said, long seen as a major obstacle to the relaxation of Beijing’s no-tolerance approach to Covid. Rare demonstrations against the ruling Communist Party’s zero-Covid strategy broke out across China late last month. They expanded into calls for more political freedoms, with some even calling for President Xi Jinping to resign. Related News  China eases COVID-19 measures after protests  Covid protest: China censors feed from World Cup  UK condemns China for BBC journalist's arrest Authorities cracked down on subsequent efforts to protest while easing a number of restrictions, with some Chinese cities tentatively rolling back mass testing and curbs on movement. The capital Beijing, where many businesses have fully reopened, said this week that commuters were no longer required to show a negative virus test taken within 48 hours to use public transport. Financial hub Shanghai, which underwent a brutal two-month lockdown this year, announced the same rules, with residents able to enter outdoor venues such as parks and tourist attractions without a recent test. And once dominated by doom and gloom coverage of the dangers of the virus and scenes of pandemic chaos abroad, China’s tightly controlled media dramatically shifted tone to support a tentative moving away from zero-Covid. The prevalent Omicron strain is “not at all like last year’s Delta variant,” Guangzhou-based medicine professor Chong Yutian said in an article published by the Communist Party-run China Youth Daily. “After infection with the Omicron variant, the vast majority will have no or light symptoms, and very few will go on to have severe symptoms, this is already widely known,” he assured readers. But analysts at Japanese firm Nomura on Monday calculated that 53 cities — home to nearly a third of China’s population — still had some restrictions in place. Wednesday’s announcement came hours after the government released further data showing the crippling economic impacts of zero-Covid. Imports and exports plunged in November to levels not seen since early 2020. Imports in November fell 10.6 percent year-on-year, the biggest drop since May 2020, according to the General Administration of Customs. Exports fell 8.7 percent over the same period.

135,"  2023: BVAS to curtail rigging, electoral malpractices - Igini  ","A former Resident Electoral Commissioner for Akwa-Ibom State of the Independent National Electoral Commission  Mike Igini, said the newly introduced Bimodal Voters Accreditation System would curtail rigging and other forms of electoral manipulations commonly perpetrated by politicians. The former REC made this known during the 2023 election townhall organised by the Abuja leadership centre, a centre of excellence in public governance set up by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund at the University of Abuja. According to a statement made available to our correspondent on Wednesday, the town hall was organised to deepen political participation of young Nigerians by providing them with the necessary trainings required for leadership. Speaking at the event, Igini said, “There will be a major paradigm shift in the 2023 polls as voters now have the ultimate power to determine winners of election. “INEC has designed a system that has brought power to the people, that is why many politicians are now afraid. “The introduction of Bimodal Voter Accreditation System in the conduct of elections will curtail rigging and other form of voting manipulations by politicians . Polling unit, ward and local government collation centres are now mere ceremonial collation centres as results entered into the BVAS are automatically loaded into the cloud system. “The amended Electoral Act proscribes severe punishment- a prison term of not less than one year or N10 million fine for electoral official that attempts to change election results.” Also quoted in the statement, the vice-chancellor of the University of Abuja, Professor Abdulrasheed Na’allah said, “This Centre of Excellence on Public Governance and Leadership has given us the opportunity to help develop leadership for this nation.

Speaking further, the don cited example of Singapore that got it right on leadership recruitment system which catapulted it from a third world country to a first world nation within a short period of time. On the 2023 general elections, the Vice Chancellor called on young people to participate fully in the process, adding that the Abuja Leadership Centre’s decision to organise the townhall would go a long way to address the issue of political apathy among young Nigerians ahead of the 2023 polls. “The Centre is bringing people of thought, people who are articulate, who constantly have been discussing this and allowing us to talk about it in an environment where our young people are seating, because they are the future of us. ”They will begin to imbibe this and they will also begin to ask questions. We want Nigerians to be asking these questions. Is voting the end of the story? Or voting and seat there and proudly say- I am standing and seating by my vote?” He said. On his part, the Director of the Centre, Professor Philip Afaha, said the townhall purposely targeted young people in order to boost their participation in the next year’s elections and subsequent electoral processes in the country. His words, “The objective of organising this town hall is to educate the public and not just the public but the young public. The University is predominantly peopled by young Nigerians and they have the right to know what will be happening in the country by February and March next year. “We are approaching a very significant phase in our nation which has to do with electing those that will be in charge in the next four years. It is important to educate the young minds because these are people that are disengaged from the leadership system and establishment. “Election is very important and cannot be left in the hands of politicians alone.

Maikyau stated that the lawyers’ umbrella body, had in a letter copied to the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, asked Olanipekun to step aside as leader of the BoB pending investigations into allegations of misconduct against him by Adekunbi Ogunde, who claimed he (Olanipekun) influenced judges to favour clients who patronise his firm.  The NBA had consequently told Olanipekun to allow his deputy, Justice Mary Odili (retd.), to preside over the Call to Bar, a request he ignored. At the ceremony, Olanipekun advised the new lawyers to always uphold the ethics of the profession and desist from acts that could portray the profession in a bad light.
